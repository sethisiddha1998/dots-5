2019-04-06 21:58:48	Toxmi	Any input or recomendation from experienced users? I like to not have those warining but I think more packages means less security and more hassles
2019-04-06 21:58:59	jamespharvey20	Edu4rdSHL: "qemu-system-x86_64 -soundhw es1370 -net nic -net user -cdrom /home/jamespharvey20/Downloads/android-x86_64-8.1-r1.iso -smp cpus=4 -m 4096M -drive format=raw,file=/dev/lvm/vm_android" and although I can install, I can't do much else.  Booting hd after install or cd in live mode just shows text screen eventually of "x86_64:/ #" and it reboots.  Debug mode kicks me out to "MirBSD Korn Shell", and

2019-04-06 21:59:01	jamespharvey20	typing exit twice to continue booting just reboots.  All attempts beyond install switch to a higher resolution before rebooting, showing something on there.  Tried debug nomodeset and it seems to get in a loop with avc denied errors, getting to 870 seconds.
2019-04-06 21:59:10	jamespharvey20	Toxmi: that always shows up, ignore it
