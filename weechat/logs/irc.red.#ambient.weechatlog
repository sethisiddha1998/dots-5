2018-05-03 14:43:25	WhatFun	I wish the CD FLAC wouldn't have had that ripping problem though...
2018-05-03 14:44:49	r2xx	yea
2018-05-03 14:45:00	r2xx	i downloaded the web and deleted the cd flac
2018-05-03 14:45:56	WhatFun	same. irks me though because I would normally select CD over WEB

2018-05-03 17:10:14	~water	j/c why you prefer web over cd
2018-05-03 17:10:20	~water	i used to but switched to CD recently
2018-05-03 17:12:07	mew	in this case there's a ripping problem with the cd upload
2018-05-03 17:12:20	mew	looks like both what and r2 prefer cd over web tho
2018-05-03 17:12:45	r2xx	i prefer the one with most tracks
2018-05-03 17:12:51	r2xx	cd or web dont matter
2018-05-03 17:12:58	mew	tru
2018-05-03 17:13:11	WhatFun	That's iffy for me; depends on whether the extra track is good
2018-05-03 17:13:12	mew	if theres a good cd rip and the tracks are the same then i go cd
2018-05-03 17:13:25	WhatFun	Some extra tracks are... obviously extra?
2018-05-03 17:15:02	WhatFun	I only choose CD over WEB because of the burnable CUE. I like the idea that I can recreate a physical release media perfectly if I wanted to
2018-05-03 17:15:54	mew	mmm yes
2018-05-03 17:27:34	~water	i used to choose web
2018-05-03 17:27:45	~water	cuz imo if its recorded/mastered in pro tools
2018-05-03 17:27:54	~water	adding it to a CD is just another step
2018-05-03 17:28:03	~water	between release and being a file on my comp
2018-05-03 17:28:22	~water	but i choose CD now because i like log/cue/checksum
2018-05-03 17:28:22	WhatFun	That is also a totally valid argument
2018-05-03 17:28:43	~water	the recreating the media thing is cool, even though ill never do that probably
2018-05-03 17:28:51	~water	but i just like knowing theres some sort of like
2018-05-03 17:28:56	~water	authenticity file
2018-05-03 17:29:38	~water	i don't think there's any loss whatsoever between a WEB straight out of the mastering software and the same files burned to a CD and ripped w/ 100% log
2018-05-03 17:32:20	WhatFun	When the WEB is 44.1khz 16bit, I agree, but I do worry about exactly how careful they were with resampling in other cases
2018-05-03 17:33:15	~water	sure ya
2018-05-03 17:34:48	WhatFun	I guess there's a downside to knowing that much about mastering, huh? "This is good stuff. But did they use the correct sampling algorithm???"
2018-05-03 17:39:19	~water	lol
2018-05-03 17:39:30	~water	I took a mastering class at school
2018-05-03 17:39:33	~water	I did very poorly in it lol
2018-05-03 17:56:47	zzzeyez	ehh i suck at mastering
