2018-05-11 14:39:49	antsygirl	 its frowned upon. if you dont want to respond that's ok too but i hope you feel better and find some solace somewhere because even though i am essentially an internet stranger i think you're good stuff and seeing you here always brightens my mood and my day <3
2018-05-11 16:08:12	zzzeyez	oh shit i just saw this sorry haha.  and i do appreciate you reaching out to me :)  i feel lots better now.  yeah the room was crazy and when my friend video chatted me while using drugs it super affected me.  especially 'cause a dif friend just died from it

2018-05-11 16:12:28	antsygirl	it's ok, also shit man that's great! gtfo!!!
