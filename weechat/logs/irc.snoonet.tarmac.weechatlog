2018-04-20 23:23:33	tarmac	yeah, i got it
2018-04-20 23:23:41	tarmac	thats why i logged on.
2018-04-20 23:23:53	tarmac	staring contests with drugs.
2018-04-20 23:23:56	tarmac	they are rough
2018-04-20 23:24:05	zzzeyez	i'm not a mod and i smoke too but shhh about it in this chan
2018-04-20 23:24:18	zzzeyez	also they will ban you if you msg other members or talk about msging members
2018-04-20 23:24:28	zzzeyez	just don't want you to get kicked
2018-04-20 23:25:47	tarmac	so this conversation is off limits?
2018-04-20 23:27:01	zzzeyez	well i mean it's not like they can see.  and members do seem to message each other a little.  but i have seen people report it and the person get banned
2018-04-20 23:27:41	tarmac	odd, im curious your opinion on the smoking vs drinking thing
2018-04-20 23:28:16	zzzeyez	well i'm from colorado and it's looked at differently here i think
2018-04-20 23:28:36	zzzeyez	i don't smoke that often rly anymore but i don't see it as a sobriety thing
2018-04-20 23:28:41	tarmac	right on, im in summit co. 
2018-04-20 23:30:19	tarmac	so how did you differentiate the two? I've done mushrooms and not considered it to break sobriety.
2018-04-20 23:32:39	zzzeyez	mmm i just don't see weed or mushrooms as a toxic thing personally, they have nothing to do with my alcohol sobriety
2018-04-20 23:32:46	zzzeyez	but the rest of the world does not look at it that way
2018-04-20 23:32:56	zzzeyez	some AA groups allow weed, some don't
