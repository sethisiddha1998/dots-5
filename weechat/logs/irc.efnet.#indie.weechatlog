2018-02-25 19:01:35	pyro	Ok, I am going to explain you idiots why being alive is actually gay. So as you guys may know, being alive requires breathing the atmosphere, which is approximately 78.084% Nitrogen, 20.946% Oxygen, 0.9340% Argon etc. There's a lot of other things including the vapor of whatever liquids you're around at the moment. Now, to get to the point, every man that ever ejaculated has traces of sperm in 
2018-02-25 19:01:36	pyro	his penis, sperm is a liquid which means it evaporates all the time and escapes into the atmosphere. That means that by breathing you're swallowing sperm, and that's gay.

2018-02-28 12:50:13	zzzeyez	lots of people are dying from fake xanax that contains fentanyl (an opiate)
2018-02-28 12:50:27	zzzeyez	so people are quitting xanax now, or lots of them
2018-02-28 12:50:59	zzzeyez	but Lil Xan said he switched to hydrocodone..  which is just another opiate + tylenol
2018-02-28 13:01:52	ovns	I wonder what Lil Uzi Vert thinks.

2018-02-28 15:40:04	Elfeckin	fucking assholes
2018-02-28 15:40:16	Elfeckin	THIS is why the goverment or whomevber neendto regulate all drugs
2018-02-28 15:44:05	myr	those are both things that are regulated. people are going to be dumb as fuck no matter what the government does
2018-02-28 15:45:51	Elfeckin	ok thatsa goodpoint
2018-02-28 15:46:04	Elfeckin	i guess imtalking about heroin and shit that cut with fentanyl
2018-02-28 15:47:07	myr	it won't happen. they couldn't make as much money off of it if they did that
2018-02-28 15:48:51	zzzeyez	lol
2018-02-28 15:49:12	zzzeyez	how do you think they make money off of it?
2018-02-28 15:49:24	zzzeyez	not that i disagree
2018-02-28 15:53:19	myr	partly from being able to get more funding so they can be "tough on drugs" but civil forfeiture is a huge source of income too
2018-02-28 15:54:02	myr	oh you have a pipe in your car? let me take your car and your house and all your money too
2018-02-28 15:54:10	myr	your grandson sold some pot, I'll take your house now granny
2018-02-28 15:55:17	myr	even if you're cleared of charges they don't have to give your shit back
2018-02-28 16:01:21	zzzeyez	i see, i was just wondering if you were saying they were involved in the production
2018-02-28 16:01:47	zzzeyez	but in Elfeckin's defense, maybe it would help to completely legalize all drugs and regulate them
2018-02-28 16:02:36	Elfeckin	isnt that working out fine in certian places?
2018-02-28 16:02:41	zzzeyez	but shit, these days i more often feel like the black market should keep getting the monies 
2018-02-28 16:03:02	zzzeyez	yeah Elfeckin it is working well
2018-02-28 16:05:23	myr	I wouldn't be surprised if they were making money that way too somehow
2018-02-28 16:05:25	myr	honestly
2018-02-28 16:05:46	myr	and yeah, in countries that have decriminalized the rates of usage and deaths have gone down

2018-03-02 13:50:59	s1zZLe	with no health coverage, do you 'muricans get a hospital bill if you have a baby?

2018-03-02 13:51:13	s1zZLe	how does that shit work?
2018-03-02 14:59:46	ovns	It costs like $20K.
2018-03-02 15:02:02	ovns	A lot of that cost is due to so many women getting C-sections so doctors don't have to deliver a baby at midnight and/or mess up the mother's sweet sweet puss.

2018-03-05 20:13:43	s1zZLe	you okay bro?
2018-03-05 20:14:24	s1zZLe	i'm glad your impulse is to come here and type random gibberish
2018-03-05 20:14:37	s1zZLe	rather than to beat your kids over a cold burger
2018-03-05 20:14:41	s1zZLe	;P
2018-03-05 20:15:25	ovns	I'm going to side with Elfeckin here - food temp. is paramount.
2018-03-05 20:15:47	s1zZLe	For some foods sure
2018-03-05 20:15:55	s1zZLe	but i've never been a fan of eating my food while it's piping hot
2018-03-05 20:16:00	ovns	It may be a Celcius thing that causes you to eat all those cold burgers.
2018-03-05 20:16:13	s1zZLe	like if you have to breathe funny, huff and puff while shoveling it into your mouth, it's too fucking hot
2018-03-05 20:16:43	s1zZLe	i picture that being exactly how jesse eats
2018-03-05 20:16:54	ovns	I burn the roof of my mouth with eggs on the regs.
2018-03-05 20:18:58	s1zZLe	like, eating a piping hot greasy burger fresh off the grill, so hot he has to make weird squinty face to curl his lips back to avoid burning them while he does that "hyoytch-hyoytch-hyoytch-hyoytch" sound while chewing in a way so that the food only touches his teeth and the saliva bath in under his tongue

2018-03-05 20:55:58	s1zZLe	initially, the currencies were driven by the mining activity, once people start trading it for real money, then it gains real speed and weight
2018-03-05 20:56:07	s1zZLe	but.. it's kind of stupid, and hella risky

2018-03-08 14:49:04	Elfeckin	i hate when companies do that. inevitbaly your phones baterty will start crapping out and you as a customer should be able to swap in a new one 
2018-03-08 15:51:04	s1zZLe	by the time my battery is that old, i'll want a newer phone anyway
2018-03-08 16:12:52	s1zZLe	i'm actually surprised you still have the s4

2018-03-12 21:03:06	s1zZLe	so i would rather the photographer just take the photo from a distance without my knowing
2018-03-12 21:03:23	s1zZLe	if it was like "hey can you post *like this* for my picture"
2018-03-12 21:03:28	s1zZLe	i would straight up say

2018-03-12 21:21:28	zzzeyez	how would you feel s1zZLe if someone asked if they could eat lunch with you because they feel weird eating alone
2018-03-12 21:21:36	s1zZLe	then I would open my jacket to reveal my t-shirt that reads "i'm a judgmental prick"
2018-03-12 21:21:45	s1zZLe	hrmm

2018-03-13 20:57:58	zzzeyez	was someone told him to check carbon monoxide levels because he might be getting poisoned and forgetting he is writing the notes, this was actually the case

2018-03-19 05:55:10	s1zZLe	opioids are some of the strongest drugs, and are responsible for the most drug-related deaths.

2018-03-19 09:31:36	zzzeyez	u.s. govt not going to win the war on drugs, give up already 
2018-03-19 09:36:10	zzzeyez	if they really wanted to releive the problem then they would quit trying to ban kratom
2018-03-19 09:37:53	zzzeyez	the consequence of heavy opiates is already Death and no one is stopping man

2018-03-19 20:37:49	@prence	I caught wind of my boss trying to fire me (because she left an email in the printer that said CONFIDENTIAL) with my name on it
2018-03-19 20:38:04	@prence	so I went to HR and was like "here's the fucking list of ways this department is run terribly"
2018-03-19 20:38:08	@prence	and beat her to the punch
2018-03-19 20:38:12	@prence	now I wish I never did
2018-03-19 20:38:18	@prence	if she had gotten rid of me, I'd get unemployment
2018-03-19 20:38:19	Beeble_	is she making life hell
2018-03-19 20:38:23	@prence	now if I quit, I get nothing

2018-03-19 20:39:07	@prence	her nephew is all suicidal so she's been in for like 5 hours the last 3 weeks while still barking orders (with no training, I can do whatever if I know what I'm doing) via cell phone
2018-03-19 20:39:27	@prence	and today my coworker goes "ya know what, I don't care, I hope her life situation gets worse"
2018-03-19 20:39:39	@prence	I was like damn homie I mean .. okay yeah, me too
2018-03-19 20:39:42	@prence	FUCK EM ALL
2018-03-19 20:40:14	@prence	and she's polynesian but racist towards asian people? I guess at an event some asian dude cut in line and she goes to my coworker "asian men just think they can have whatever they please"
2018-03-19 20:40:23	philsabot	haha
2018-03-19 20:40:25	Beeble_	shit in her office hide it well

2018-03-19 20:40:56	@prence	it would have been if it wasn't in front of student workers from another dept and a WHOLE FUCKLOAD of deans
2018-03-19 20:41:06	@prence	it just makes my dept look bad, making me look bad by proxy

2018-03-19 20:42:07	@prence	and I don't get union protection for another 2.5 weeks, then once I do I can ask for a "bump" to another dept, same paygrade etc
2018-03-19 20:42:11	@prence	but those can take 2 months
2018-03-19 20:42:25	@prence	so it's a possible 2.5 months until I get out
2018-03-19 20:42:36	@prence	I've got my resignation letter written

2018-03-19 20:50:09	@prence	we have equal intelligence but she had the smarts to get a masters and keep kicking ass
2018-03-19 20:50:12	@prence	while I lazed off
2018-03-19 20:50:35	@prence	so if she can get us somewhere else, somewhere where she can get a spousal hire (oh, yeah, that's a thing in higher ed..)

2018-03-19 20:51:27	@prence	also I'm pretty sure it's high up there on shark attacks
2018-03-19 20:51:37	@prence	so maybe the surfing isn't going to be so much for me

2018-03-25 18:54:09	zzzeyez	http://github.com/zzzeyez
2018-03-25 18:54:28	s1zZLe	[20:02] <shaan> i dont like google
2018-03-25 18:54:30	s1zZLe	but you like apple?
2018-03-25 18:54:45	zzzeyez	i might prefer apple to google ethically
2018-03-25 18:54:48	 *	zzzeyez shrugs
2018-03-25 18:54:52	zzzeyez	google is fucking up man
2018-03-25 18:55:12	s1zZLe	i think anyone would fuck up
2018-03-25 18:55:35	s1zZLe	the access that companies like apple and google receive into our daily lives is kind of too much power for anyone to have
2018-03-25 18:55:42	s1zZLe	but, it something that exists
2018-03-25 18:56:09	zzzeyez	i use their services
2018-03-25 18:56:24	zzzeyez	i'm not the most ethically sound person but i'm trying
2018-03-25 18:57:54	zzzeyez	this is so fucked
2018-03-25 18:58:32	zzzeyez	i think i want to be with someone who is an alcoholic and i also really want to stay sober.  will i ever be ready to deal with normal life again
2018-03-25 18:58:49	zzzeyez	two people trying to get clean together does NOT work.  i learned that with heroin
2018-03-25 18:59:35	s1zZLe	interesting
2018-03-25 19:00:04	s1zZLe	what's more important to you?  Your sobriety, or being with that girl?
2018-03-25 19:00:23	s1zZLe	I figure it's your sobriety
2018-03-25 19:00:24	zzzeyez	idk dude
2018-03-25 19:00:26	s1zZLe	so like
2018-03-25 19:00:32	zzzeyez	yeah probably
2018-03-25 19:00:33	s1zZLe	long-run
2018-03-25 19:00:36	s1zZLe	big picture
2018-03-25 19:00:46	s1zZLe	how long do you actually think a relationship with her might last?
2018-03-25 19:01:18	zzzeyez	that's another scary part.  we were involved as teenager, she has been with the same guy since.  they broke up, she has kids now
2018-03-25 19:01:25	zzzeyez	so potentially a very long time
2018-03-25 19:01:37	s1zZLe	i mean
2018-03-25 19:01:41	zzzeyez	i don't know why she came looking for me, i'm the worst for long term shit
2018-03-25 19:01:52	s1zZLe	i dunno
2018-03-25 19:02:01	Elfeckin	your a loner zzzeyez a rebel;
2018-03-25 19:02:04	Elfeckin	=^D
2018-03-25 19:02:10	s1zZLe	sounds to me like she's just accustomed to being with someone.. when her relationship ended, she reached out to the first person she could think of ... her last bf
2018-03-25 19:02:21	zzzeyez	possibly
2018-03-25 19:02:28	s1zZLe	and sounds to me like you have bigger priorities than getting mixed up with an alcoholic at this point in your life
2018-03-25 19:02:30	zzzeyez	but that was 11 years ago
2018-03-25 19:02:32	zzzeyez	so bizarre
2018-03-25 19:02:34	s1zZLe	i mean, all depends what you're looking for
2018-03-25 19:02:37	zzzeyez	yeah
2018-03-25 19:02:40	zzzeyez	no you're right dude
2018-03-25 19:03:06	zzzeyez	i've also barely been single though, i hate being single
2018-03-25 19:03:15	s1zZLe	why?
2018-03-25 19:03:16	neoKEN	i got a baby coming
2018-03-25 19:03:22	zzzeyez	wow sick neoKEN!
2018-03-25 19:03:27	s1zZLe	congrats ken
2018-03-25 19:03:36	neoKEN	i wish it was congrats
2018-03-25 19:03:46	s1zZLe	pfft
2018-03-25 19:03:49	s1zZLe	another one of those
2018-03-25 19:03:52	s1zZLe	the fuck is wrong with people
2018-03-25 19:03:53	s1zZLe	i can't
2018-03-25 19:03:58	s1zZLe	LIFE ISN'T THAT HARD
2018-03-25 19:04:00	neoKEN	i love children
2018-03-25 19:04:00	s1zZLe	fuck
2018-03-25 19:04:04	zzzeyez	working to improve your life and experience new things for yourself seems pointless, it's nice to share it with someone and be cared for
2018-03-25 19:04:09	neoKEN	but i hate the baby mama
2018-03-25 19:04:15	zzzeyez	oh no neoKEN 
2018-03-25 19:04:21	neoKEN	:-(
2018-03-25 19:04:29	s1zZLe	if you hate her, why did you blow your load in her?
2018-03-25 19:04:31	neoKEN	I'm sure we hate each other
2018-03-25 19:04:36	s1zZLe	that wasn't smart
2018-03-25 19:04:55	neoKEN	of all my years, this never happened to me
2018-03-25 19:05:00	neoKEN	i pulled out
2018-03-25 19:05:04	s1zZLe	[21:04] <zzzeyez> working to improve your life and experience new things for yourself seems pointless, it's nice to share it with someone and be cared for
2018-03-25 19:05:22	zzzeyez	i had a dream where is slept with the trans person again and they were completely girl and then they said they faked pregnancy to lock me in miami
2018-03-25 19:05:24	s1zZLe	what's the longest you've gone single?
2018-03-25 19:05:39	neoKEN	baby is coming in June
2018-03-25 19:05:48	s1zZLe	neoKEN: people still think pulling out works?
2018-03-25 19:05:51	zzzeyez	two years
2018-03-25 19:05:54	s1zZLe	i learned in like 1993 that that's silly
2018-03-25 19:06:00	neoKEN	it worked for me so many years LOL
2018-03-25 19:06:01	zzzeyez	in 2009
2018-03-25 19:06:05	neoKEN	most of my life actually
2018-03-25 19:06:08	s1zZLe	weird
2018-03-25 19:06:19	s1zZLe	i've barely had any unprotected sex in my life tbh
2018-03-25 19:06:26	neoKEN	we liked each other
2018-03-25 19:06:27	s1zZLe	but i've had like 12 "scares"
2018-03-25 19:06:34	neoKEN	until she got pregnant and we each wanted different things
2018-03-25 19:06:44	neoKEN	i had only 2 scares in my life
2018-03-25 19:06:49	s1zZLe	eh i have a different philosophy on that shit than most guys i think
2018-03-25 19:06:50	neoKEN	but i wasn't scared
2018-03-25 19:06:57	neoKEN	i would had been happy if they were pregnant
2018-03-25 19:07:08	neoKEN	this was the ONLY girl I feared who would get pregnant
2018-03-25 19:07:13	s1zZLe	i'm so opposed to having kids (for myself) that even if it means i miss out on a really good fuck, i won't do it without a condom
2018-03-25 19:07:35	zzzeyez	yeah i have low sex drive and don't really care about sex personally
2018-03-25 19:07:40	zzzeyez	but i would maybe want to have kids
2018-03-25 19:07:40	s1zZLe	same
2018-03-25 19:07:43	s1zZLe	it's been a looong time for me
2018-03-25 19:07:56	neoKEN	my sex drive matches the person I am with
2018-03-25 19:07:57	zzzeyez	but also i have a hard time with responsibilities
2018-03-25 19:08:13	neoKEN	my eastern european ex was hot so i had sex everyday
2018-03-25 19:08:17	neoKEN	multiple times a day 
2018-03-25 19:08:39	zzzeyez	sometimes it's like that, if i'm in a relationship and i like them
2018-03-25 19:08:44	zzzeyez	but like i don't make decisions over sex
2018-03-25 19:09:01	neoKEN	sex doesn't determine if i'm in a relationship or not
2018-03-25 19:09:09	neoKEN	it's nice but not the whole world for me
2018-03-25 19:09:33	neoKEN	my other ex, my sex drive went down after a year with her
2018-03-25 19:09:47	neoKEN	but she made me happy and we clicked mentally of the future
2018-03-25 19:10:39	neoKEN	I KNOW I would be a good dad
2018-03-25 19:10:47	neoKEN	that's kind of how I was raised
2018-03-25 19:12:45	neoKEN	I worry about the future of this kid with only her raising it
2018-03-25 19:13:01	neoKEN	the kid will do OK with her, I'm certain of it
2018-03-25 19:13:15	neoKEN	she's high IQ, medical field, and well off parents
2018-03-25 19:13:35	neoKEN	but with me, I can push the kid's potential unlike anything else
2018-03-25 19:14:58	neoKEN	one time in the past, I discussed having an abortion with her then she threaten to sue the shit out of me from child support!
2018-03-25 19:15:56	s1zZLe	i'll never understand why chicks do that
2018-03-25 19:16:19	s1zZLe	accidentally get pregnant, and then still want to keep the baby despite breaking up with the dad and him not wanting it
2018-03-25 19:16:24	s1zZLe	that's such a shitty thing to do imo
2018-03-25 19:16:32	s1zZLe	condemn a person to a life of unwanted parenthood
2018-03-25 19:16:36	s1zZLe	then again
2018-03-25 19:16:40	s1zZLe	it's also sort of your fault too
2018-03-25 19:16:45	neoKEN	that really scared me and I told her. she apologize and said she was just being emotional
2018-03-25 19:16:45	s1zZLe	two to tango and all that
2018-03-25 19:17:01	s1zZLe	herein lies why i have been single for literally ten years
2018-03-25 19:17:03	neoKEN	but i never forgot what she said because that scared me a lot
2018-03-25 19:17:14	neoKEN	and confirms my mom's stereotype of american woman
2018-03-25 19:17:15	s1zZLe	save for the odd "relationship" that always last less than a year
2018-03-25 19:17:38	s1zZLe	what stereotype?  That they're all dumb and selfish
2018-03-25 19:17:39	s1zZLe	ayyy
2018-03-25 19:17:45	s1zZLe	also crazy
2018-03-25 19:17:45	neoKEN	that's one part of it
2018-03-25 19:17:51	neoKEN	sleeps around
2018-03-25 19:18:00	neoKEN	will sue you
2018-03-25 19:18:07	s1zZLe	ie: dumb and selfish
2018-03-25 19:18:10	neoKEN	take half of what they never earned
2018-03-25 19:18:12	s1zZLe	the main underlying factors
2018-03-25 19:18:29	s1zZLe	<-- never getting married
2018-03-25 19:18:39	s1zZLe	if i end up in another long-term relationship, it will be a miracle
2018-03-25 19:18:57	neoKEN	I seriously want my own family
2018-03-25 19:19:11	neoKEN	I could had been happy with her if she wasn't so stubborn all the time
2018-03-25 19:19:18	s1zZLe	i mean, i like the idea of "my own family" but i dread the actual thought of the day-to-day
2018-03-25 19:19:21	neoKEN	very narcisstic 
2018-03-25 19:19:39	neoKEN	we're both talented people, but I don't go about acting like I know all
2018-03-25 19:20:05	s1zZLe	it's a shame that you two weren't an exact match
2018-03-25 19:20:09	s1zZLe	and sucks she's doing what she's doing
2018-03-25 19:20:13	s1zZLe	hopefully it all works out
2018-03-25 19:20:17	s1zZLe	i mean, you're gonna be a dad
2018-03-25 19:20:20	s1zZLe	so that's kinda cool
2018-03-25 19:20:25	 *	s1zZLe lights a cigar
2018-03-25 19:20:25	neoKEN	ironically we are a match in most things lol
2018-03-25 19:20:35	s1zZLe	well obviously not
2018-03-25 19:20:39	neoKEN	except we can't stand each other haha
2018-03-25 19:20:47	s1zZLe	being into the same shit doesn't mean you're a match
2018-03-25 19:21:02	s1zZLe	two people can have all the same interests and passions, but have bad chemistry with each other
2018-03-25 19:21:14	neoKEN	no. our abilities, skillset, interest
2018-03-25 19:21:22	s1zZLe	but mindset
2018-03-25 19:21:23	s1zZLe	is key
2018-03-25 19:21:33	s1zZLe	and all it takes is some fundamental differences of world-view, or perception of your own place in the world
2018-03-25 19:21:36	s1zZLe	self-awareness, etc.
2018-03-25 19:21:45	neoKEN	like i prefer to live in city, she prefers to stay in her mountain area 30 minutes away from city
2018-03-25 19:21:53	s1zZLe	that's exactly what i mean
2018-03-25 19:22:04	s1zZLe	sounds to me like you weren't a match other than in superficial ways
2018-03-25 19:22:20	s1zZLe	but differed in the fundamentals
2018-03-25 19:22:37	s1zZLe	not sure why i'm being all holier-than-hou
2018-03-25 19:22:37	neoKEN	I told her kids should live in city to be expose to just "more" while she thinks country is better than she grew up there..
2018-03-25 19:22:38	s1zZLe	sorry
2018-03-25 19:22:48	s1zZLe	*thou
2018-03-25 19:23:24	neoKEN	I have my own issues too
2018-03-25 19:23:31	s1zZLe	again fundamental differences
2018-03-25 19:23:31	neoKEN	I can be too blunt and direct
2018-03-25 19:23:45	neoKEN	that's not the r ight way to talk to women
2018-03-25 19:23:53	neoKEN	have to be gentle with them. I'm not
2018-03-25 19:24:16	s1zZLe	i guess you're not dating anyone right now?
2018-03-25 19:24:45	neoKEN	I just came back from Mexico
2018-03-25 19:24:52	neoKEN	and I am
2018-03-25 19:25:13	s1zZLe	then to hell with the babymama thing
2018-03-25 19:25:21	neoKEN	this Mexican girl is total opposite of baby mama
2018-03-25 19:25:22	s1zZLe	it didnt work out and it is what it is, no sense over-thinking it
2018-03-25 19:25:24	s1zZLe	good
2018-03-25 19:25:39	neoKEN	the only similarity they s hare is both are very beautiful
2018-03-25 19:26:19	neoKEN	the Mexican girl is more traditional which I like
2018-03-25 19:26:33	s1zZLe	does the mexican girl live in mexico?
2018-03-25 19:26:43	neoKEN	yeah haha
2018-03-25 19:26:49	s1zZLe	sheesh

2018-03-25 19:26:53	s1zZLe	?
2018-03-25 19:27:12	neoKEN	we were just FB friends. nothing more

2018-03-25 19:27:39	s1zZLe	how did you meet grandma?
2018-03-25 19:27:44	neoKEN	language exchange app

2018-03-25 19:27:51	neoKEN	Facebook
2018-03-25 19:27:56	s1zZLe	interesting
2018-03-25 19:28:05	neoKEN	I wanted to see other parts of Mexico
2018-03-25 19:28:14	neoKEN	and i thought having a cute guide would be cool
2018-03-25 19:28:25	neoKEN	for the longest time, I didn't know s he liked me 
2018-03-25 19:28:31	s1zZLe	that's creepy
2018-03-25 19:28:33	neoKEN	it wasn't until I was about to go
2018-03-25 19:28:43	s1zZLe	"hey i'm looking to travel around mexico, wanna be my gf?"
2018-03-25 19:29:01	neoKEN	it's not like that haha
2018-03-25 19:29:09	neoKEN	i guided a bunch of people before
2018-03-25 19:29:25	neoKEN	I'm very connected thanks to FB
2018-03-25 19:29:50	neoKEN	me and her were decent friends on fb for a long time
2018-03-25 19:29:57	neoKEN	and she just broke up with ex too
2018-03-25 19:30:39	neoKEN	ironically, the week I was in Mexico with her  was the 1 year anniversary I knew her through FB 
2018-03-25 19:30:42	neoKEN	#woah

2018-03-25 19:32:28	neoKEN	crazy fucking coincident
2018-03-25 19:32:38	neoKEN	now that's story to tell the grandkids
2018-03-25 19:33:07	neoKEN	she was really cold, and not very talkative to me
2018-03-25 19:33:25	neoKEN	then I ask her about her ex bf. 
2018-03-25 19:33:47	neoKEN	how he became her bf? how long they knew each other?
2018-03-25 19:34:17	neoKEN	last day, he was about the leave, he gave her a letter to ask her to be his gf
2018-03-25 19:35:11	neoKEN	after she told me, I sent her a poem I've written for her
2018-03-25 19:35:21	neoKEN	and ask her to be my gf. I was expecting a rejection lol
2018-03-25 19:37:28	neoKEN	she told me she thought i didn't like her lol

2018-03-25 21:09:05	zzzeyez	it's the new day and age / to pave the way / to let you go / untangled waves / and not be a slave / to corporate grays / cause you've got the glaze / and no one finds out
2018-03-25 21:09:47	s1zZLe	there's something about your vocals that remind me of sdr
2018-03-25 21:09:55	s1zZLe	especially at that part

2018-03-25 21:14:03	zzzeyez	never meant to be an emo musician but hey it is what it is
2018-03-25 21:17:09	s1zZLe	you don't really get to choose what you become
2018-03-25 21:17:10	s1zZLe	life makes you
2018-03-25 21:17:41	s1zZLe	for some of us
2018-03-25 21:18:21	s1zZLe	you only control who you are
2018-03-25 21:18:39	s1zZLe	lol that's not really true
2018-03-25 21:18:42	s1zZLe	i was trying to be profound
2018-03-25 21:18:47	s1zZLe	but there's some truth to it, for artists
2018-03-25 21:21:25	zzzeyez	i think we just reflect whatever we have taken in our whole life
2018-03-25 21:21:33	zzzeyez	and maybe no artistic ideas even belong to use
2018-03-25 21:21:34	zzzeyez	us*
2018-03-25 21:21:44	zzzeyez	you just put your head in the cloud real quick and bounce shit back out
2018-03-25 21:23:18	s1zZLe	kinda yeah

Amazon announced today that its digital assistant Alexa will be integrated into the Amazon Shopping app for iOS. This gives all users with Apple mobile devices access on the go. While some iOS users may have the Alexa app already downloaded to support their Amazon Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo, this integration lets users speak to Alexa while away from their h

2018-03-27 16:38:15	s1zZLe	or is she past that point of logic?
2018-03-27 16:38:17	Elfeckin	but the alcohal says no
2018-03-27 16:38:21	s1zZLe	ah
2018-03-27 16:38:23	s1zZLe	fak
2018-03-27 16:38:25	zzzeyez	as long as your brother stays out of it she should be fine even drunk
2018-03-27 16:38:26	zzzeyez	right?
2018-03-27 16:38:27	Elfeckin	alcoholic
2018-03-27 16:38:29	s1zZLe	man this is the first i've heard of this
2018-03-27 16:38:42	Elfeckin	thats what i say zzzeyez , my brotehr frucked everything up sp bas
2018-03-27 16:38:43	Elfeckin	bad
2018-03-27 16:38:46	s1zZLe	i thought things were on the positive momentum sicne teh detox thing
2018-03-27 16:38:59	Elfeckin	my kids were scared and afraid of cops fo a good 3 weeksafter he left
2018-03-27 16:38:59	s1zZLe	Elfeckin; just don't let THAT be a reason to get worse, so you can blame him
2018-03-27 16:39:04	s1zZLe	you're still in control of your own action
2018-03-27 16:39:07	Elfeckin	fucking trauma tizedthem....
2018-03-27 16:39:15	Elfeckin	itsbetter now but wtf man 
2018-03-27 16:39:17	zzzeyez	yeah no that was fucked of your brother dude
2018-03-27 16:39:30	zzzeyez	the problem isn't on you guys, it was on him imo
2018-03-27 16:39:38	s1zZLe	err well
2018-03-27 16:39:38	Elfeckin	well that time it was
2018-03-27 16:39:40	s1zZLe	i sort of disagree
2018-03-27 16:39:44	Elfeckin	i know everything else is on me nad her
2018-03-27 16:40:09	zzzeyez	yeah that's a subjective thing.  i don't see anything wrong with parents being drunk if they are still good parents
2018-03-27 16:40:20	s1zZLe	i kind of agree with his motivation behind doing what he did though.  It seems like an "i don't care how you two feel about it, i'm looking out for the best interest of the children because you're too both fucked up to do so"
2018-03-27 16:40:29	s1zZLe	i mean
2018-03-27 16:40:35	zzzeyez	nah dude Elfeckin and his lady are good parents
2018-03-27 16:40:42	zzzeyez	i could tell just from being there
2018-03-27 16:40:43	s1zZLe	i mean sure they love them and shit
2018-03-27 16:40:44	s1zZLe	but like
2018-03-27 16:40:46	zzzeyez	i have seen bad parents
2018-03-27 16:40:53	s1zZLe	what are the current chances of those daughter growing up to be junkie alcoholics as well?
2018-03-27 16:41:01	s1zZLe	i think THAT's the point his brother is making
2018-03-27 16:41:22	s1zZLe	Right now, yes it's best for kids to be with their parents.  But if those parents only teach them a world of inebriation and debauchery, then no
2018-03-27 16:41:22	zzzeyez	i think it's a genetic thing.  but studies do show that: children of alcoholics turn into people-pleaser types
2018-03-27 16:41:35	s1zZLe	lol not in my experience
2018-03-27 16:41:44	s1zZLe	most alcoholics i know were raised by alcholics, or shitty parents in general
2018-03-27 16:41:57	zzzeyez	yeah no clue
2018-03-27 16:42:29	s1zZLe	being nice and loving them isn't the only thing you gotta do to be a good parent
2018-03-27 16:42:34	s1zZLe	you have to be a good example as well
2018-03-27 16:42:43	s1zZLe	you can't say you're a good parent just because you hug your kids and don't beat them
2018-03-27 16:42:52	s1zZLe	what type of world are you shaping for them?  What type of mindset are you instilling in them?
2018-03-27 16:43:16	zzzeyez	that's it man, cage match me vs you right Now Right Here dude
2018-03-27 16:43:24	zzzeyez	:P
2018-03-27 16:43:26	s1zZLe	lol
2018-03-27 16:43:43	Elfeckin	yes but when the parenst aer smart enough to say hey kids
2018-03-27 16:43:46	Elfeckin	we did drugs
2018-03-27 16:43:50	Elfeckin	we fucked up our lives

2018-03-27 16:44:26	s1zZLe	i will never believe for a moment that your wife doesn't get drunk in front of the kids.
2018-03-27 16:44:38	s1zZLe	so it's not only genetic
2018-03-27 16:44:40	Elfeckin	both of my parents were fucking sober!!!!!!!!!!!
2018-03-27 16:44:46	Elfeckin	drink on hoildays

2018-03-27 16:51:57	zzzeyez	and then you click their profile and it's an ad to get followers
2018-03-27 16:52:15	s1zZLe	ahh lame
2018-03-27 16:52:24	s1zZLe	all of social media seems flooded with that shit

2018-03-27 16:52:31	zzzeyez	yeah it's getting really bad
2018-03-27 16:52:44	zzzeyez	i think 2008 was the golden age of the internet tbh
2018-03-27 16:52:58	s1zZLe	i'd agree
2018-03-27 16:53:17	s1zZLe	but i kinda preferred like 2003-2005 era when internet still wasn't really mainstream
2018-03-27 16:53:34	s1zZLe	i mean it was, but only people who could figure shit out were able to get online
2018-03-27 16:53:38	s1zZLe	now everything is super easy and user-friendly
2018-03-27 16:53:41	s1zZLe	but broken
2018-03-27 16:53:44	s1zZLe	because people break shit
2018-03-27 16:53:46	s1zZLe	on purpose
2018-03-27 16:54:58	zzzeyez	yeah that was great too
2018-03-27 16:55:06	zzzeyez	like soulseek and dc++ etc, message boards
2018-03-27 16:55:11	zzzeyez	pre-web2.0
2018-03-27 16:55:24	zzzeyez	i like web 2.0 but i don't like this corporate shit going down
2018-03-27 16:58:49	s1zZLe	true
2018-03-27 16:58:55	s1zZLe	i remember reading about web 2.0 before it happened too
2018-03-27 16:58:59	s1zZLe	thinking "faacck that's gonna suck"

2018-03-28 17:50:04	zzzeyez	yeah
2018-03-28 17:50:09	zzzeyez	the rule is half your age + 6
2018-03-28 17:51:05	zzzeyez	but then again society through history does not follow that, so it's not like some embedded rule in us humans
2018-03-28 17:51:28	zzzeyez	it all depends man
2018-03-28 17:52:42	zzzeyez	but fuck dude i almost hooked up with a 50 year old lady (she was cute) on christmas and it turned out to be my brother's boss, so maybe i would have gotten him a raise

2018-03-29 14:46:11	shaan	shut up assbuts
2018-03-29 14:46:16	shaan	im sry
2018-03-29 14:57:27	zzzeyez	umm.  i just recorded myself playing guitar and singing and i realized my nostrils flare up when i sing big time.  interesting, and embarassing too
2018-03-29 15:09:59	zzzeyez	at thanksgiving dinner when the family starts fighting s1zZLe says a bunch of mean shit and then says "sorry ill be quiet" and just starts eating endless amounts of bread to occupy his mouth lol
2018-03-29 15:24:22	s1zZLe	Elfeckin: you gotta get used to typing /clear sometimes
2018-03-29 15:25:07	s1zZLe	and no zzzeyez, in that situation i'll literally sit there with my lips tightened and eyes widened, looking around at people until i finally say my little piece and storm off
2018-03-29 15:26:12	s1zZLe	also Elfeckin, be careful that she's not making you out to be a monster, to her friends and shit
2018-03-29 15:26:23	s1zZLe	when someone is dysfunctional, rather than admit their own problems, they'll blame someone else
2018-03-29 15:26:56	s1zZLe	plus when people are THAT fucked up, i think other people assume there is some kind of abuse going on
2018-03-29 15:27:02	s1zZLe	no one self-destructs that outwardly for no reason
2018-03-29 15:56:14	Elfeckin	^bingo
2018-03-29 15:56:57	Elfeckin	im not innocent in all of this ... but the thinsg she does far out way what ive done... idk its fucked :-/ love ypppppy
2018-03-29 16:22:38	s1zZLe	i just hope you guys figure shit out because it sounds like it's only getting worse
2018-03-29 16:23:03	Elfeckin	feels like it tooo
2018-03-29 16:24:36	s1zZLe	:(
2018-03-29 16:25:26	Elfeckin	my brains fucked , but hers is worse =(
2018-03-29 16:26:33	s1zZLe	sounds like youre toxic for each other
2018-03-29 16:26:40	s1zZLe	might have been fun and shit when you were young and partying was a novelty
2018-03-29 16:26:50	s1zZLe	but now it has become a dysfunctional life
2018-03-29 16:27:32	s1zZLe	i dunno man, these days, i'm kind of the worst person to talk to about this shit
2018-03-29 16:29:09	s1zZLe	I don't understand grown-ups who willingly stay in shitty situations or relationships.  It boggles my mind
2018-03-29 16:29:17	s1zZLe	i'm not judging
2018-03-29 16:29:25	s1zZLe	but the only thing i want to say to you is "leave the bitch and if you don't, you're stupid>'
2018-03-29 16:29:42	s1zZLe	she gonna wait til the kids are in highschool to try & change?

2018-03-29 16:47:12	zzzeyez	s1zZLe is a pragmatic person
2018-03-29 16:47:27	zzzeyez	i say make amends dude, get marriage counseling.  drugs are manageable, it's part of life
2018-03-29 16:47:33	zzzeyez	everyone has their vices
2018-03-29 16:48:06	zzzeyez	you guys are great parents tbh
2018-03-29 16:50:14	Elfeckin_	thanks dan, that means alot
2018-03-29 16:50:19		Elfeckin_ is now known as Elfeckin
2018-03-29 16:53:52	s1zZLe	see, dan knows how to handle this shit better than me
2018-03-29 16:53:56	s1zZLe	i'm the "fuck it, walk away" guy
2018-03-29 16:54:03	s1zZLe	dan has more life experience though
2018-03-29 16:57:24	zzzeyez	well that approach has it's place too
2018-03-29 16:58:37	zzzeyez	but hey Elfeckin if she is tripping about irc, you could mention that there's even a #stopdrinking irc that's pretty great
2018-03-29 16:58:47	zzzeyez	no one is allowed to message each other or say their real names etc
2018-03-29 16:59:00	zzzeyez	super inclusive and everyone kind of understands the issue
2018-03-29 16:59:04	zzzeyez	it helps me lots personally
2018-03-29 16:59:30	zzzeyez	maybe that would support the idea that irc = emotional support and not just a place to talk shit on her, you know?
2018-03-29 17:00:52	Elfeckin	but ii dont just talk shit =(
2018-03-29 17:01:08	Elfeckin	its a much neede outlet for me
2018-03-29 17:01:18	Elfeckin	least i see it that way
2018-03-29 17:01:25	zzzeyez	yeah it's a much healthier one then friends and family (regarding love)
2018-03-29 17:01:37	zzzeyez	but hey s1zZLe , remember when i was dating that girl and got put in jail and shit
2018-03-29 17:01:49	zzzeyez	and you were like: stop fucking drinking, get away from that girl, and get your shit together
2018-03-29 17:01:58	zzzeyez	ultimately what did i have to end up doing :P

2018-03-29 17:42:23	zzzeyez	my stint with kratom was serene.  my gf and i were not fighting at all, i was doing great at work, all my friendships were on good terms, i laid around with my cat lots.  it was cool
2018-03-29 17:42:31	zzzeyez	but then it got temp banned so i moved back to drinking

2018-04-02 14:05:55	Elfeckin	i dont wanna grow up im a toys rus kid
2018-04-02 14:08:52	@prence	I don't want to grow up either and I probably won't, I still play video games, it's just that my wife and I take turns on playing video games while the other reads or I do homework for my NEXT degree
2018-04-02 14:12:08	s1zZLe	same
2018-04-02 14:12:12	s1zZLe	i refuse to grow up
2018-04-02 14:12:43	s1zZLe	i still play way more video games than anyone my age should, i just consciously tried to get into anime.  
2018-04-02 14:12:58	s1zZLe	But I always manage to hold down a half-decent job and pay my bills without drama or stress
2018-04-02 14:13:12	s1zZLe	oh and i smoke weed like a high schooler
2018-04-02 14:13:47	s1zZLe	the way I see it is; as long as my fundamental responsibilities are covered, i'm gonna relax and have fun doing what id o
2018-04-02 14:13:57	s1zZLe	lost that sense of "forward progression" long ago
2018-04-02 14:13:57	@prence	I've been asking people for years to recommend something like cowboy bebop
2018-04-02 14:14:06	@prence	nothing has come class, been way too japanese for me haha
2018-04-02 14:14:13	s1zZLe	i haven't seen cowboy bepop yet

2018-04-02 14:14:22	s1zZLe	and Code Geass
2018-04-02 14:14:33	@prence	and yeah I'm the same, minus the forward progression, I keep trying, I should finish my business degree in fall
2018-04-02 14:14:42	s1zZLe	oh nice
2018-04-02 14:15:30	s1zZLe	i honestly wish i could motivate myself to get a degree of some kind
2018-04-02 14:15:40	s1zZLe	might do accounting, just because it'll be an automatic raise at work
2018-04-02 14:24:31	zzzeyez	dude FUCK forward progression
2018-04-02 14:25:05	zzzeyez	also staying stagnant too though

2018-04-12 15:47:52	@prence	This week, Choice Bank Ltd, the financial institution offering loadable card payout methods via FirstChoicePay and Paxum, issued a statement saying they have been forced into a “liquidity-constrained position.” This essentially means that they have been forced to suspend all withdrawals and outbound payments by their financial regulators.  
2018-04-12 15:47:52	@prence	Paxum issued a similar statement, and are in the process of contracting a new card-issuer. At this time, Choice Bank-issued Paxum cards can no longer be loaded via transfer, but any funds that have already been loaded are fully available and can be used as normal.

2018-04-15 14:32:44	zzzeyez	did you listen to the new ATDI Elfeckin 
2018-04-15 14:33:51	zzzeyez	i'm listening right now for the first time that i can remember
2018-04-15 15:21:58	s1zZLe	i enjoyed the new atdi
2018-04-15 15:22:05	s1zZLe	although i do have some opinions about it
2018-04-15 15:29:37	zzzeyez	like what:
2018-04-15 15:32:45	s1zZLe	it annoyed me that nearly every track had some sort of electro/ambient introduction before the rock kicks in
2018-04-15 15:32:49	s1zZLe	or songs end with them
2018-04-15 15:33:01	s1zZLe	and they don't often fit with the song
2018-04-15 15:33:30	s1zZLe	when i see that happen, i cant' help but think that, after tracking and mixing all the songs, the guys realised "oh fuck, our entire album is only 22 minutes long, that's like an EP length>.. we need to add some filller"
2018-04-15 15:33:36	s1zZLe	and just add 30 to 60 seconds of random noise to every song
2018-04-15 15:34:48	Beeble_	sounds like a good way t0o make an album
2018-04-15 15:35:37	s1zZLe	not if you dislike ambient music, especially when it's injected into a rock album
2018-04-15 15:35:54	s1zZLe	ambient music is for people with no rhythm or sense of timing.
2018-04-15 15:35:58	s1zZLe	:)
2018-04-15 15:36:04	s1zZLe	(just kidding)
2018-04-15 15:36:50	Beeble_	I was joking as well!
2018-04-15 15:37:06	Beeble_	but I've def. heard albums where I felt what you described is exactly what thye did
2018-04-15 15:38:02	s1zZLe	at the drive-in - In•ter a•li•a
2018-04-15 15:38:03	s1zZLe	def is
2018-04-15 15:38:06	s1zZLe	it's still good
2018-04-15 15:38:21	s1zZLe	but when you realise it's like 50% filler in between some rocking tracks, it's like.... meh
2018-04-15 15:38:33	Beeble_	a lot of times ambient interludes are there to transition between drastically different tracks
2018-04-15 15:39:25	s1zZLe	most atdi songs pack the same wallop
2018-04-15 15:40:12	zzzeyez	as a kid i always just wanted to make interludes
2018-04-15 15:40:28	zzzeyez	but holy fuck that shit was funny:  Beeble_ sounds like a good way t0o make an album
2018-04-15 15:41:39	zzzeyez	ambient music is for ppl with keen cents of polyrythmn
2018-04-15 15:43:53	s1zZLe	or just..... jazz

2018-04-16 15:55:19	s1zZLe	oddly enough, that jay barushcel guy talks a bit in the doc
2018-04-16 15:55:19	zzzeyez	damn wtf hockey players commit suicides ?
2018-04-16 15:55:26	@prence	did it come out and I miss it or what
2018-04-16 15:55:29	s1zZLe	there have been a few
2018-04-16 15:55:34	@prence	dude they get CTE just like NFL players
2018-04-16 15:56:07	s1zZLe	and i think people play the narrative as "hockey guy made it pro but had to fight, hated fighting but did it anyway for the money.. it made him miserable so after a while he killed himself" type of storyline
2018-04-16 15:56:09	shaan	not just like
2018-04-16 15:56:14	shaan	they are like "soory brain"
2018-04-16 15:56:24	s1zZLe	they go pretty into depth about concussions 
2018-04-16 15:56:41	s1zZLe	NHL doctors broke the stigma that fighting should be outlawed because of concussions
2018-04-16 15:56:48	s1zZLe	only about 5% of concussions are the result of fights
2018-04-16 15:56:57	@prence	so this is how bad hockey fighting and head injuries are and how insane enforcers are
2018-04-16 15:56:59	s1zZLe	about 90% are due to impact that doesn't include the head
2018-04-16 15:57:04	s1zZLe	just body-on-body impact that rocks you
2018-04-16 15:57:06	s1zZLe	rattles the brain
2018-04-16 15:57:18	@prence	a few years back they said you have to keep your helmet on when you fight unless it falls off mid-fight
2018-04-16 15:57:19	s1zZLe	no
2018-04-16 15:57:20	zzzeyez	should art be a self-indulgent, self-discovery thing, or should it be made to entertain other peoples
2018-04-16 15:57:26	@prence	so guys would take each others helmets off
2018-04-16 15:57:32	@prence	then they made that a penalty
2018-04-16 15:57:49	@prence	(that's how weird hockey is, you want to fucking fight so badly but you politely take off the other guys helmet to square off)
2018-04-16 15:58:16	s1zZLe	not to mention, the fight is often just one guy doing his job.. no ill-will or anything
2018-04-16 15:58:39	shaan	shutup canuck
2018-04-16 15:59:08	@prence	https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=DLo5CX0O2To
2018-04-16 15:59:21	s1zZLe	I think it was George Parros that told a story about how one time he was on the ice and a young enforcer kid slapped his stick and said "hey man, do you think we can fight?  they're gonna send me back down to the minors if we don't"
2018-04-16 15:59:29	@prence	watch Quaider and tell me that he didn't fuck that guys head up
2018-04-16 15:59:52	shaan	http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=cutthroat
2018-04-16 15:59:52	s1zZLe	shaan:  why you gotta be such a bully?
2018-04-16 15:59:54	shaan	:o
2018-04-16 16:00:00	shaan	s1zZLe, CUZ U A BITCH
2018-04-16 16:00:02	shaan	i mean im sorry
2018-04-16 16:00:04	s1zZLe	you're so 90s
2018-04-16 16:00:08	@prence	s1zZLe, that's a super typical story
2018-04-16 16:00:13	@prence	and doesn't surprise me
2018-04-16 16:00:14	zzzeyez	yeah why are you so mean to s1zZLe shaan 
2018-04-16 16:00:32	zzzeyez	every day you punch him in the face, no reason at all 
2018-04-16 16:00:38	shaan	im mean 
2018-04-16 16:00:40	@prence	watch almost any milan lucic fight
2018-04-16 16:00:48	@prence	he trained as a boxer as a kid while playing hockey
2018-04-16 16:00:49	s1zZLe	lucic is a beast
2018-04-16 16:01:10	@prence	I miss him but he's got lead skates now
2018-04-16 16:01:10	 *	zzzeyez slaps s1zZLe with a wet trout
2018-04-16 16:01:15	@prence	takes him forever to gain the blue line 
2018-04-16 16:01:25	 *	s1zZLe steps aside and lets zzzeyez fight the fight
2018-04-16 16:01:30	s1zZLe	[18:00] <shaan> s1zZLe, CUZ U A BITCH
2018-04-16 16:01:31	@prence	I'm glad the bruins got rid of him when they did
2018-04-16 16:01:32	s1zZLe	^^^^^^^^
2018-04-16 16:01:58	@prence	s1zZLe, have you seen The Code? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwe6LgsPn-A
2018-04-16 16:01:59	waf6lebot	Title: The Code: Documentary on Fighting in Hockey, Views: 683868, Rating: 91.0%
2018-04-16 16:02:13	@prence	it's a lot older but
2018-04-16 16:02:16	s1zZLe	Yeah i think so
2018-04-16 16:02:22	s1zZLe	seems familiar
2018-04-16 16:02:27	@prence	probably is
2018-04-16 16:02:33	@prence	it was kind of inspired by those gretzky teams
2018-04-16 16:02:44	s1zZLe	it makes sense
2018-04-16 16:02:46	@prence	go after gretzky, they always had a guy there to beat the fuck out of you
2018-04-16 16:02:55	s1zZLe	that's sort of the argument made in Ice Guardians
2018-04-16 16:02:59	s1zZLe	because Crosby has had SO many concussions
2018-04-16 16:03:05	s1zZLe	he's the most concussed superstar in NHL history
2018-04-16 16:03:23	@prence	yeah he's going to be a fucking sad case in 20 years
2018-04-16 16:03:26	s1zZLe	because of the instigator penalty thing
2018-04-16 16:03:32	@prence	one of the best players in the nhl but man
2018-04-16 16:03:38	s1zZLe	Yeah i was just thinkign that last night.  Dude won't be able to talk by the time he's 40
2018-04-16 16:03:40	@prence	when he gets old, he's not gonna be able to see straight
2018-04-16 16:03:41	@prence	yeah
2018-04-16 16:03:44	@prence	sucks :\
2018-04-16 16:03:48	s1zZLe	price you pay
2018-04-16 16:03:50	s1zZLe	to be the best
2018-04-16 16:03:54	s1zZLe	most celebrated player of a generation
2018-04-16 16:04:01	-->	^Incubus_ (Incubus@bzq-79-179-122-166.red.bezeqint.net) has joined #indie
2018-04-16 16:04:23	s1zZLe	and i'm pretty sure he's more decorated than gretzky now
2018-04-16 16:04:31	s1zZLe	but hockey is "a different game now"
2018-04-16 16:04:44	zzzeyez	fuck being braindead seems to be a reward tbh
2018-04-16 16:04:50	@prence	some toronto fucking asshole writer wrote shit the other day about marc savard
2018-04-16 16:04:57	@prence	and how he never answers the phone or hockey questions
2018-04-16 16:05:20	@prence	and savard was like "dude I got elbowed in the head, multiple concussions, it hurts to turn the lights on in my house, why the fuck would I want to talk about that"
2018-04-16 16:05:44	@prence	the guy gave such a half-assed apology
2018-04-16 16:05:50	s1zZLe	yeah no shit
2018-04-16 16:05:51	@prence	"You got paid by the sport so you should give interviews"
2018-04-16 16:05:53	s1zZLe	i never heard about that
2018-04-16 16:05:54	@prence	he's fucking retired
2018-04-16 16:05:56	@prence	leave him alone.
2018-04-16 16:05:56	s1zZLe	and kind of forgot about savard
2018-04-16 16:06:07	@prence	he was my favorite player
2018-04-16 16:06:09	@prence	fuck matt cooke

2018-04-16 16:06:52	s1zZLe	are two of my most hated players right now
2018-04-16 16:06:56	@prence	haha
2018-04-16 16:07:01	@prence	fuck kadri
2018-04-16 16:07:05	@prence	but I have to like marshy
2018-04-16 16:07:11	@prence	unless you goes somewhere else
2018-04-16 16:07:26	s1zZLe	i mean
2018-04-16 16:07:27	@prence	kadri had the dirtiest hit in the fucking playoffs so far
2018-04-16 16:07:31	@prence	did you see that garbage?
2018-04-16 16:07:32	s1zZLe	i love his style of hockey
2018-04-16 16:07:36	s1zZLe	but marchand can be so dirty
2018-04-16 16:07:39	s1zZLe	and so cockyk about it
2018-04-16 16:07:41	s1zZLe	*cocky
2018-04-16 16:07:47	@prence	yeah but he's like .. not ruin your life dirty
2018-04-16 16:07:49	s1zZLe	actually no i still need to check that out
2018-04-16 16:07:55	@prence	he's slash your knees when nobody is watching dirty
2018-04-16 16:08:03	s1zZLe	marchand is a slewfoot master
2018-04-16 16:08:03	@prence	or punch you with gloves on when there's nobody around
2018-04-16 16:08:09	@prence	that's true
2018-04-16 16:08:19	@prence	but he's knocked that off the last 2 years or so
2018-04-16 16:08:43	s1zZLe	the kadri hit you're talking about from this years playoffs
2018-04-16 16:08:45	s1zZLe	was it on wingels?
2018-04-16 16:08:47	@prence	yep
2018-04-16 16:09:00	s1zZLe	holy shit
2018-04-16 16:09:03	@prence	dude was on his knees and kadri just 15 foot strides into his face, smashed into the boards
2018-04-16 16:09:08	@prence	yeah man
2018-04-16 16:09:14	@prence	that was hard to watch in real time
2018-04-16 16:11:03	@prence	steve montador, a smaller enforcer with concussion issues, killed himself last year I believe
2018-04-16 16:11:06	s1zZLe	i can imagine
2018-04-16 16:11:20	s1zZLe	that hit kind of reminded me of the pacioretty/chara hit a few years back
2018-04-16 16:11:28	s1zZLe	hate those crazy hits on the boards, so fucking dangerous
2018-04-16 16:11:58	@prence	I'm glad they fixed those boards
2018-04-16 16:12:07	s1zZLe	never heard of steve matador
2018-04-16 16:12:13	@prence	but at the same time, seriously? nobody in the NHL saw that could be a problem?
2018-04-16 16:12:16	@prence	buffalo sabres
2018-04-16 16:12:55	@prence	Known as a scrappy forward who lived on the margins of an NHL roster, Rypien was found dead in his Southern Alberta home, with police saying they did not suspect foul play. Rypien, who drew 226 penalty minutes in 119 regular-season games with the Vancouver Canucks, had been living with depression.
2018-04-16 16:12:55	@prence	Teammate Kevin Bieksa has said he and his wife asked Rypien to move in with them, “just so we could kind of keep an eye on him, and be an ear for him,” and that they would stay up late just to talk with him.
2018-04-16 16:13:00	@prence	stuff like that kills me
2018-04-16 16:13:06	@prence	Rypien was 27.
2018-04-16 16:13:25	s1zZLe	yeah i knew about rick rypien
2018-04-16 16:13:31	s1zZLe	that suuucks
2018-04-16 16:13:43	s1zZLe	must be a tough lifestyle
2018-04-16 16:13:47	@prence	there's also a lot of guys that were just so beaten up from being enforcers that they developed pain killer addictions
2018-04-16 16:13:49	@prence	and died that way
2018-04-16 16:13:54	@prence	so it was technically a "suicide"
2018-04-16 16:13:56	s1zZLe	oh no doubt
2018-04-16 16:13:59	@prence	accidental overdose blah blah
2018-04-16 16:14:06	s1zZLe	you really should check out that doc i mentioned haha
2018-04-16 16:14:09	@prence	wasn't technically*
2018-04-16 16:14:13	s1zZLe	lots of pros go into stories about that
2018-04-16 16:14:22	s1zZLe	drinking and drugs
2018-04-16 16:14:24	s1zZLe	fighting
2018-04-16 16:14:26	s1zZLe	"the pro life"
2018-04-16 16:14:27	@prence	I've got it downloaded and I'll watch it tonight after I finish the andre the giant thing
2018-04-16 16:14:38	s1zZLe	yeah i need to find that andre thing
2018-04-16 16:14:58	s1zZLe	i need to get with the times and setup a media center or whatever people do these days
2018-04-16 16:14:58	@prence	have an ftp I can upload it to?
2018-04-16 16:15:05	s1zZLe	nah
2018-04-16 16:15:27	s1zZLe	i'm just so used to sticking with netflix when i feel like watching shit.
2018-04-16 16:15:32	s1zZLe	i'm behind on everything current.
2018-04-16 16:15:37	@prence	I'd give you an account on my PLEX server but I got into an argument with comcast today because they want to charge me 20 bucks more for the same speeds I'm already paying
2018-04-16 16:15:49	@prence	then the guy was like "okay well ill give you 500 MBPS for the same price"
2018-04-16 16:15:51	@prence	"deal"
2018-04-16 16:15:56	@prence	"oh actually it's not in your area"
2018-04-16 16:16:11	s1zZLe	if i really want to see a specific new movie, i'll download and put it on a thumb drive to watch via ps4.. but then it's a bitch sometimes finding the right formats that work on ps4.
2018-04-16 16:16:21	@prence	"so you want me to pay more for the same speeds? if it's not in my area by the next billing cycle I'm canceling"
2018-04-16 16:16:25	s1zZLe	bahaha gotta love when they do that
2018-04-16 16:16:36	@prence	I was furious
2018-04-16 16:16:38	s1zZLe	"i have this amazing deal for you... oh wait... i'm sorry, it's not available in your area"
2018-04-16 16:16:43	@prence	seriously
2018-04-16 16:16:43	s1zZLe	'JUST KIDDING'
2018-04-16 16:16:50	s1zZLe	dude
2018-04-16 16:17:00	@prence	I was like "you know Google Fibre is in Portland, I can play the waiting game"
2018-04-16 16:17:00	s1zZLe	at least you don't have to deal with canadian wireless providers
2018-04-16 16:17:04	@prence	"I'm sorry you feel that way"
2018-04-16 16:17:09	s1zZLe	lol
2018-04-16 16:17:25	@prence	I heard most of canada is a dead zone outside major cities
2018-04-16 16:18:03	@prence	I had service in quebec city, montreal, and toronto but that was pretty much it on the eastern side
2018-04-16 16:18:12	@prence	even newfoundland was like .. do people live here?!
2018-04-16 16:18:13	s1zZLe	i'm sure it's a problem in the prairies provinces where it's nothing but rural land and scattered population
2018-04-16 16:18:27	s1zZLe	well imean.
2018-04-16 16:18:28	s1zZLe	i unno
2018-04-16 16:18:32	@prence	are they just really pricey?
2018-04-16 16:18:38	s1zZLe	and limited
2018-04-16 16:18:39	s1zZLe	get this
2018-04-16 16:18:41	@prence	haha nobody knows if anyone lives in newfoundland
2018-04-16 16:18:44	s1zZLe	my previous plan, that i had for 3 years
2018-04-16 16:19:03	s1zZLe	$95.00 a month for 2gb data, and unlimited nationwide calling (plus texting and voicemail and all that standard shit)
2018-04-16 16:19:18	@prence	hooooly shit
2018-04-16 16:19:28	s1zZLe	when i went to get a new phone, they were like "oh that plan is no longer offered, to do a hardware upgrade you have to choose a new "in-market" plan"
2018-04-16 16:19:45	s1zZLe	and the plan with the exact same shit i had was gonna come to $115.00
2018-04-16 16:19:49	s1zZLe	was like wtf
2018-04-16 16:19:52	@prence	mine is 89 for 2 lines with 6 gigs of data each, but it's more now that I added the cost of 2 Pixel 2s to the plan
2018-04-16 16:19:53	@prence	wow
2018-04-16 16:20:13	s1zZLe	I get a new phone for free on a 2 year plan, but my plan services stay the same but goes up by $20 a month?  how does that make sense?"
2018-04-16 16:20:43	s1zZLe	i managed to negotiate into a better plan.. so i have 4gb data instead of 2gb
2018-04-16 16:20:46	s1zZLe	for $110
2018-04-16 16:20:49	s1zZLe	but still
2018-04-16 16:20:51	@prence	well then, I was going to spend the summer driving coast to coast through canada but if I can't get GPS or anything, I'm kinda fucked
2018-04-16 16:20:51	s1zZLe	that seems like rape
2018-04-16 16:21:19	@prence	I always get super paranoid and shut my phone off like 15 miles from the border lol
2018-04-16 16:21:19	s1zZLe	i reallly don't think it'll be an issue man
2018-04-16 16:21:21	s1zZLe	it's 2018
2018-04-16 16:21:47	@prence	well I don't have international, my plan was to do a month-to-month with a canadian company
2018-04-16 16:21:54	@prence	and then just turn it in when I get to the other side
2018-04-16 16:22:23	@prence	I can point out almost every country on a map but I don't know where edmonton or calgary are
2018-04-16 16:22:29	@prence	so I figured I should probably figure that out
2018-04-16 16:22:50	@prence	and I'd like to go to a blue jays game, just cause
2018-04-16 16:23:04	s1zZLe	you americans and your basebell
2018-04-16 16:23:19	@prence	dude, a few seasons ago when they were doing well, it was cheaper to get a hotel room and watch
2018-04-16 16:23:21	@prence	than to get tickets

2018-04-16 16:24:59	@prence	I know it's an "unwritten rule" (like the hockey ones) but if I could blast a HR 420 feet, I'd probably watch that shit too
2018-04-16 16:26:55	s1zZLe	hahaha
2018-04-16 16:27:07	s1zZLe	i mean at least til you get somewhere private, you know it'l be on youtube

2018-04-16 16:28:20	@prence	haha
2018-04-16 16:28:45	@prence	I'm debating on doing stand-up if we move to north carolina
2018-04-16 16:29:11	@prence	I stopped doing it because of youtube shit, I don't want to be on youtube for a set that fails
2018-04-16 16:29:16	@prence	or something I say that's really bad
2018-04-16 16:30:04	@prence	I've got a feeling that folks in NC won't really rape
2018-04-16 16:30:05	@prence	err
2018-04-16 16:30:06	@prence	TAPE
2018-04-16 16:30:09	@prence	bahaha

2018-04-16 16:32:12	@prence	man
2018-04-16 16:32:15	@prence	that's all I do lol
2018-04-16 16:32:20	s1zZLe	a wise man once said; it's better to be infamous than to never be famous at all
2018-04-16 16:32:29	s1zZLe	maybe society needs that right now?
2018-04-16 16:32:35	@prence	the problem is that if it doesn't pan out, it'll be REALLY hard to get a job
2018-04-16 16:32:36	s1zZLe	seems like people forgot what humour is
2018-04-16 16:32:41	s1zZLe	lol
2018-04-16 16:32:44	@prence	also I don't usually do political jokes but fuck man

2018-04-16 16:32:58	s1zZLe	well like
2018-04-16 16:32:58	@prence	especially in a red state like NC
2018-04-16 16:33:04	@prence	I can piss a lot of people off lol
2018-04-16 16:33:05	s1zZLe	what kind of thing could you say/do that might offend someone?
2018-04-16 16:33:13	s1zZLe	religious stuff?
2018-04-16 16:33:20	@prence	um that's the state that had the bathroom laws
2018-04-16 16:33:28	s1zZLe	refresh my memory
2018-04-16 16:33:34	@prence	about which bathroom a trans person could piss in
2018-04-16 16:33:40	@prence	cause they thought people rape kids 
2018-04-16 16:33:43	s1zZLe	lol
2018-04-16 16:33:45	@prence	or look up stalls
2018-04-16 16:33:46	s1zZLe	right
2018-04-16 16:33:50	@prence	yeah
2018-04-16 16:33:53	s1zZLe	that never happens
2018-04-16 16:33:56	s1zZLe	<_<
2018-04-16 16:34:09	@prence	it was one of those "laws" that the rest of the country looked at them and they were like "seriously? THAT is your battle?"
2018-04-16 16:34:14	@prence	they lost a fuck ton of businesses
2018-04-16 16:34:22	@prence	paypal (fuck them too) left NC
2018-04-16 16:35:58	@prence	I dunno, my best joke, which I'll probably never do again, was about how I found out my grandfather had Alzheimers because he tried to teach me to fish by casting towards an electrical wire
2018-04-16 16:36:34	@prence	there's obviously more to the story but people in the south would view that as making fun of a disease
2018-04-16 16:36:54	@prence	altho in memphis, the joke killed
2018-04-16 16:36:57	@prence	so who the fuck knows
2018-04-16 16:37:21	@prence	I think the point is that it's easy to bomb at comedy, and that's cool, it's part of the gig, you learn from it
2018-04-16 16:37:34	@prence	but if it's on youtube, then you can't workshop it because people are like OH I SAW THIS GARBAGE
2018-04-16 16:39:38	@prence	alsooooo
2018-04-16 16:39:56	@prence	my aunt told my sister and wife that women should never be raped because all they have to do is fight back
2018-04-16 16:40:18	@prence	(during my grandma's funeral .. party? whatever that thing is afterwards)
2018-04-16 16:40:59	s1zZLe	tbh i say just do your shit, but just don't intentionally try to offend people and you should be fine
2018-04-16 16:41:19	@prence	I don't, I don't like people that are intentionally offensive
2018-04-16 16:41:41	s1zZLe	maybe even inject little disclaimers here and there.  Like for the grandfather bit, be like "and i'm not making fun of alheimers here, i mean, it's obviously a horrible and tragic disease that ails many, including my grandfather."
2018-04-16 16:41:48	s1zZLe	to be safe
2018-04-16 16:41:52	s1zZLe	in case something does end up on youtube
2018-04-16 16:41:56	@prence	eh that takes you out of the moment
2018-04-16 16:41:59	@prence	but
2018-04-16 16:42:06	@prence	you bring up a good point
2018-04-16 16:42:09	s1zZLe	if done well it can be part of the joke
2018-04-16 16:42:58	@prence	hm
2018-04-16 16:43:06	@prence	in any case, that's only if we move

2018-04-16 16:47:52	@prence	I wonder if it was like "well.. he's running against Nixon, who is more likely to start a nuclear war?"

2018-04-19 13:42:06	s1zZLe	actually, both male and female genitals are considered "self-cleansing" organisms, so they actually clean themselves so you don't have to.
2018-04-19 13:42:15	s1zZLe	also, the sour smell of your penis is the natural smell of penis
2018-04-19 13:42:16	s1zZLe	embrace it
2018-04-19 13:46:48	myr	they also didn't start out being constantly covered by clothing. it's much easier to be self cleaning when there's exposure to more than your tighty whities

2018-04-21 09:44:41	s1zZLe	neoKEN: yes it has weighted keys
2018-04-21 09:45:44	s1zZLe	pretty sure all digianos at that price range do
2018-04-21 09:45:58	s1zZLe	as it is one of the features of a piano vs. a keyboard
2018-04-21 09:54:26	s1zZLe	Bohemian Rhapsody (film)
2018-04-21 09:54:32	s1zZLe	Release date
2018-04-21 09:54:32	s1zZLe	November 2, 2018
2018-04-21 09:54:36	s1zZLe	i hope that ends up being good
2018-04-21 11:01:55	zzzeyez	who has more power:
2018-04-21 11:02:06	zzzeyez	Disney, Google or WalMart
2018-04-21 11:04:02	zzzeyez	i vote Disney!
2018-04-21 11:18:54	s1zZLe	well, google is richer than both of them put together, by far
2018-04-21 11:20:03	s1zZLe	Google - Net Worth - $605 Billion
2018-04-21 11:20:21	s1zZLe	Disney - Net worth - $92 billion (as of 2016)
2018-04-21 11:21:06	s1zZLe	err my bad
2018-04-21 11:21:21	s1zZLe	Google is $527 Billion
2018-04-21 11:21:41	s1zZLe	Walmart - Net Worth - $230 Billion
2018-04-21 11:22:26	s1zZLe	however, Apple is worth $869 Billion and is the worlds largest corporation
2018-04-21 11:23:02	zzzeyez	but Disney gets to shape the minds of the youths
2018-04-21 11:23:10	s1zZLe	yeah i was going to come to that
2018-04-21 11:23:20	s1zZLe	but i have to say, i'm actually finding tons of conflicting information about the net worths of these companies
2018-04-21 11:23:23	s1zZLe	even for recent reports
2018-04-21 11:23:24	s1zZLe	but meh
2018-04-21 11:23:30	s1zZLe	yeah disney is like a propaganda machine of its own
2018-04-21 11:23:32	s1zZLe	indoctrinating kids
2018-04-21 11:24:43	zzzeyez	it's so apparent when you watch Disney shows
2018-04-21 11:24:49	s1zZLe	i know
2018-04-21 11:25:01	s1zZLe	going back and watching some of my childhood favourites as an adult was kind of scary
2018-04-21 11:25:09	zzzeyez	watch new stuff dude
2018-04-21 11:25:27	zzzeyez	cringey af
2018-04-21 11:25:40	zzzeyez	i mean even That's So Raven pissed me off as a kid

2018-04-21 11:25:52	s1zZLe	not the new ones anyway

2018-04-21 11:26:05	Elfeckin	some ar trash
2018-04-21 11:26:07	s1zZLe	but there's a lot of sexuality and shit in the newer ones i find
2018-04-21 11:26:14	Elfeckin	oh yeha my kids dont watch thoes yet
2018-04-21 11:26:21	s1zZLe	it's like "wtf.. this is intended for 4 year olds"

2018-04-21 11:28:16	s1zZLe	i'm doing great, except for this god damn dental issue that is causing the entire left side of my face to throb
2018-04-21 11:28:26	s1zZLe	and i'm on anti-biotics so i have liquid shits too
2018-04-21 11:28:53	s1zZLe	but.. i found out that on top of the $1000 tax return i'm getting for 2008... my 2016 and 2017 refunds equal another $1000.  
2018-04-21 11:28:54	Elfeckin	speaking of shit

2018-04-21 11:30:46	s1zZLe	i'm basically planning to gut it and recase it with a new gpu and maybe newer ram
2018-04-21 11:30:51	s1zZLe	eventually
2018-04-21 11:30:59	s1zZLe	but for now, its WAaaayyyyyy better than my current rig

2018-04-21 13:09:44	@prence	just working on some homework
2018-04-21 13:09:45	@prence	you?
2018-04-21 13:10:17	 *	Beeble_ works on prence
2018-04-21 13:10:57	@prence	:D
2018-04-21 13:13:30	Beeble_	what homework you working on?
2018-04-21 13:13:59	@prence	Week 5 Writing Summary
2018-04-21 13:13:59	@prence	Conduct an Internet research on the value of stretching before, during and after exercise and athletic activity to prevent muscle camps and injuries. You may find information you were not aware of that has an application in your own exercise or physical activity regimen.  Write a one-page summary on the value of stretching in your personal life.  
2018-04-21 13:14:11	@prence	somehow she wants 1 page, double spaced, but 500 words
2018-04-21 13:14:13	Beeble_	dearlord
2018-04-21 13:14:17	Beeble_	that's awful
2018-04-21 13:14:28	@prence	I could do this with my eyes closed but I need to cite sources and all that shit
2018-04-21 13:14:45	@prence	(also I only learned last year that stretching is frowned upon, I felt like an idiot)
2018-04-21 13:15:33	Beeble_	wait
2018-04-21 13:15:34	Beeble_	it is
2018-04-21 13:15:35	Beeble_	why
2018-04-21 13:16:16	@prence	because doing static stretches like we were taught to do as kids can tire out your muscles
2018-04-21 13:16:20	@prence	and make them more injury prone
2018-04-21 13:16:29	@prence	I just don't feel like writing a fucking paper about it :\
2018-04-21 13:18:28	Beeble_	because it's a lame fucking topic
2018-04-21 13:18:37	@prence	yep
2018-04-21 13:18:46	@prence	but it's a first aid and .. something else, course
2018-04-21 13:19:58	@prence	Recent studies caution people away from stretching before workouts, suggesting it actually impedes your body’s performance. According to this research, runners run more slowly, jumpers jump less high, and weight lifters lift more weakly by stretching, without significantly ensuring against injury during their exercise.
2018-04-21 13:20:31	Beeble_	also my english classes always let me choose my own topics
2018-04-21 13:21:02	@prence	well I'm getting a weird degree
2018-04-21 13:21:17	@prence	in public health and communications (even tho I already fucking have a comm degree)
2018-04-21 13:22:20	Beeble_	do you get cheap school cause suzie?
2018-04-21 13:24:22	zzzeyez	prence: that is widely regarded in skateboarding.  i personally still stretch though
2018-04-21 13:24:35	zzzeyez	Tony Hawk does not stretch for example
2018-04-21 13:24:39	@prence	Beeble_, nope :\
2018-04-21 13:24:47	zzzeyez	it's more of a mental thing for me
2018-04-21 13:24:51	zzzeyez	also endorphin rush
2018-04-21 13:25:09	@prence	zzzeyez, yeah, I didn't know this until recently, most baseball and hockey players just go out and run for 50 yards
2018-04-21 13:25:15	@prence	or go straight into their routines
2018-04-21 13:25:28	zzzeyez	take all health info with a grain of salt imo
2018-04-21 13:25:48	@prence	well my citations from this are boston college, harvard med, john hopkins
2018-04-21 13:25:54	@prence	but I sort of agree
2018-04-21 13:26:05	@prence	they were all schools that probably said "Stretch first!" 20 years ago
2018-04-21 13:26:08	Beeble_	stretching your calves just always feels right
2018-04-21 13:26:15	zzzeyez	it feels amazing
2018-04-21 13:26:42	zzzeyez	i'm so surprised you didn't have some anus-stretching remark Beeble_

2018-05-04 17:16:25	s1zZLe	first time in a long time they do so well
2018-05-04 17:16:30	s1zZLe	even though they were out in 1st round
2018-05-04 17:16:35	s1zZLe	still way better than the habs
2018-05-04 17:16:37	s1zZLe	practically dead last ffs
2018-05-04 17:16:44	s1zZLe	painful season to be a habs fan
2018-05-04 17:16:57	@prence	they took the B's to 7 games, that was fucking impressive
2018-05-04 17:17:03	@prence	especially since matthews did nothing
2018-05-04 17:17:03	s1zZLe	yeah no kidding
2018-05-04 17:17:19	s1zZLe	boston wasn't looking their best mid-series though

2018-05-04 17:17:31	s1zZLe	but the last few games, fack me
2018-05-04 17:17:44	s1zZLe	made me hate boston even more lol
2018-05-04 17:17:48	@prence	yeah, they definitely stumbled during those few games
2018-05-04 17:17:52	s1zZLe	GO TAMPA
2018-05-04 17:17:55	@prence	ha

2018-05-04 17:18:16	@prence	I can't think of a better line in hockey than marchand, bergeron, and pasta
2018-05-04 17:18:17	s1zZLe	and that weasel, marchand
2018-05-04 17:18:22	s1zZLe	yeah i know
2018-05-04 17:18:25	s1zZLe	i hate them so much

2018-05-04 17:18:35	s1zZLe	oh for sure
2018-05-04 17:18:36	s1zZLe	i mean
2018-05-04 17:18:38	@prence	if he was on any other team, I'd hate him
2018-05-04 17:18:40	s1zZLe	gallagher plays a similar style
2018-05-04 17:18:43	s1zZLe	but not as well, or strong
2018-05-04 17:18:54	s1zZLe	i wish gally was as good as marchand
2018-05-04 17:18:55	@prence	kind of like subban, when he went to nashville I didn't hate him as much
2018-05-04 17:19:04	s1zZLe	i miss subban tbh
2018-05-04 17:19:10	s1zZLe	and he's still tearing shit up
2018-05-04 17:19:13	s1zZLe	being PK
2018-05-04 17:19:13	@prence	yeah gallagher has that chip on his shoulder too
2018-05-04 17:19:16	@prence	yea
2018-05-04 17:19:43	@prence	I don't like gallag, but I respect him, he's a tiny dude that plays as fuckin hard as he can
2018-05-04 17:19:54	s1zZLe	yeah that kid is tough as nails
2018-05-04 17:20:14	s1zZLe	zero fear
2018-05-04 17:20:18	@prence	yep
2018-05-04 17:20:36	@prence	I was crushed that they traded patches to toronto
2018-05-04 17:20:41	@prence	I'd have LOVED him on boston
2018-05-04 17:21:12	s1zZLe	wait what?
2018-05-04 17:21:17	@prence	it was weird they traded him in-conference too
2018-05-04 17:21:49	@prence	err sorry
2018-05-04 17:21:51	@prence	plekanic
2018-05-04 17:21:54	s1zZLe	oh fuck
2018-05-04 17:21:54	s1zZLe	k
2018-05-04 17:21:57	s1zZLe	wow i was like what
2018-05-04 17:22:01	s1zZLe	but yeah
2018-05-04 17:22:02	@prence	I would LOVE if they traded patches to boston haha
2018-05-04 17:22:06	s1zZLe	hahaha
2018-05-04 17:22:08	@prence	but it was still a weird trade
2018-05-04 17:22:14	s1zZLe	yeah definitely
2018-05-04 17:22:30	s1zZLe	i think pleky has been wanting to get out of mtl for a few years now.  He has felt mismanaged and under-utilised
2018-05-04 17:22:38	@prence	yep
2018-05-04 17:22:41	s1zZLe	understandably.  the montreal system is so stifling of star players
2018-05-04 17:22:49	s1zZLe	or would-be star players
2018-05-04 17:22:49	@prence	he's also one of the few USA stars they have
2018-05-04 17:22:55	@prence	plus kessel
2018-05-04 17:23:13	@prence	there's not many sniper/goal scoring guys that team USA has
2018-05-04 17:23:16	@prence	those are 2
2018-05-04 17:23:23	s1zZLe	yeah true
2018-05-04 17:24:13	@prence	bruins signed Brian Gionta after the olympics, he refused to sign with anyone until they were over because of the stupid NHL decision this year
2018-05-04 17:24:17	@prence	FUCK
2018-05-04 17:24:35	s1zZLe	nhl decision?
2018-05-04 17:25:00	@prence	yeah, they decided nobody with an NHL deal could be in the olympics
2018-05-04 17:25:18	@prence	there were a couple of role players that just didn't sign with anyone so they could play with their country
2018-05-04 17:25:36	s1zZLe	oh wow
2018-05-04 17:25:42	s1zZLe	was not aware of this
2018-05-04 17:26:20	@prence	yeah, there was a bunch of talk about ovechkin sitting out the year and malkin
2018-05-04 17:26:23	@prence	neither did
2018-05-04 17:27:00	s1zZLe	what do they really gain from the olympics ?  whatever it is, it's not worth a year of their NHL star salaries.
2018-05-04 17:27:09	s1zZLe	on another note, i'm lol'ing right now while looking at the habs current roster and realising exactly why they were so horrible this year.
2018-05-04 17:27:26	s1zZLe	fucking ignorant french franchise management clearly making moves to make it a "truly canadian team"
2018-05-04 17:27:52	@prence	I mean, if you've already made 70 mil, what is one season?
2018-05-04 17:28:00	@prence	drop in the bucket
2018-05-04 17:28:23	@prence	yeah the habs .. I don't know what the fuck they're doing
2018-05-04 17:28:26	s1zZLe	possibly but if you live lavish as lifestyles and live in a house that has a 50k/month mortgage payment....
2018-05-04 17:28:30	s1zZLe	17 actual canadians on the montreal canadiens.
2018-05-04 17:28:42	s1zZLe	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens#Current_roster
2018-05-04 17:28:48	@prence	they overpaid price, and he's ELITE for sure, but not enough to handicap the rest of the roster
2018-05-04 17:29:05	s1zZLe	he'd be stupid NOT to agree to a pay cut in order to spread the money around
2018-05-04 17:29:25	s1zZLe	they'll never get anywhere unless one of those prospects actually turns out to be a star
2018-05-04 17:29:31	s1zZLe	which none of them are even close to beingyet
2018-05-04 17:29:53	@prence	yeah but you have to keep his agent in mind too, I'm sure they have a contract, and price can't just be like "well, maybe I'll take less"
2018-05-04 17:30:00	@prence	and agreed
2018-05-04 17:30:24	@prence	it's no longer the days of "we'll scout some french canadians that nobody knows about!"
2018-05-04 17:30:30	s1zZLe	they have been hyping jacob de la rose since he was 17 but he's 22 now and still has turned out to be nothing
2018-05-04 17:30:34	s1zZLe	nikita scherbak as well
2018-05-04 17:31:03	@prence	yeah, de la rose has been surprisingly bad
2018-05-04 17:31:15	@prence	well, maybe not bad
2018-05-04 17:31:20	@prence	but unexperienced 
2018-05-04 17:31:23	s1zZLe	haha but not good
2018-05-04 17:31:27	@prence	yeah lol
2018-05-04 17:31:32	s1zZLe	he has as much experience as any of those guys now

2018-05-06 14:04:13	zzzeyez	colorado region has no accent and is very well read and so i typically pride myself in being well-spoken
2018-05-06 14:04:29	zzzeyez	but some regions just have bad schools and shit.  doesn't make them worse of people, just different cultures
2018-05-06 14:06:07	zzzeyez	so yeah it's a little shitty man but also it's not your fault, it's just in our nature 
2018-05-06 14:06:30	zzzeyez	you already questioned that it might be rude so you're millions of miles ahead of the majority

2018-05-10 11:54:17	@prence	and I realized afterwards that I'm wearing celtics shorts so maybe they were like "you sure it's not a fat white guy in basketball SHORTS? no? a negro in a jersey, gotcha. we'll ask the fat white guy anyway."

2018-05-10 13:59:45	@prence	you'd hope haha
2018-05-10 14:03:35	ovns	I wonder if you're both The Crow and Aquaman - if you can control seabirds.
2018-05-10 14:06:48	ovns	Tell Russell Wilson to go fuck himself.
2018-05-10 14:08:09	@prence	nobody can control the gull.
2018-05-10 14:08:20	@prence	also I'm glad to see you back on IRC
2018-05-10 14:13:12	s1zZLe	i'm sure i probably already asked this and forgot, but i guess you're back at home now ovns?
2018-05-10 14:29:38	wrisk	wheres scalabrine?
2018-05-10 14:32:12	s1zZLe	who?
2018-05-10 14:32:50	s1zZLe	also, whoa..  Dana White said that UFC is trying to put together George St. Pierre vs. Nate Diaz
2018-05-10 14:33:32	@prence	I'm pretty sure scalabrine retired and does TNT type shit now
2018-05-10 14:33:48	@prence	also shaan just made that joke because I'm a tall ginger :(
2018-05-10 14:33:57	@prence	like if I called him Kanye
2018-05-10 14:34:44	s1zZLe	but that's racist
2018-05-10 14:35:25	@prence	calling a tall white guy the same name as another tall white guy isn't?
2018-05-10 14:35:50	s1zZLe	but like
2018-05-10 14:35:54	@prence	all of my social justicey friends say that only white people can be racist 
2018-05-10 14:35:55	s1zZLe	it's not racist when black people do it though
2018-05-10 14:36:00	@prence	and I'm not sure I agree with that
2018-05-10 14:36:09	@prence	yeah but why
2018-05-10 14:36:31	@prence	because of institutionalized racism? I guess but I didn't vote that shit in, I don't have stock in private prisons
2018-05-10 14:36:40	s1zZLe	i'm with you man, i'm just playing devils advocate
2018-05-10 14:37:00	@prence	this morning a cop was driving right behind me as I walked my dog, for about 2 minutes
2018-05-10 14:37:06	@prence	made me SUPER nervous
2018-05-10 14:37:26	@prence	and then he pulled in front of me and was like "did you see a black guy in a basketball jersey"
2018-05-10 14:37:33	@prence	in a weirdly racist kind of tone
2018-05-10 14:37:39	s1zZLe	that's the thing
2018-05-10 14:38:13	s1zZLe	i don't necessarily agree that racism is programmed or instituitionalized to the extent that people make it out to be
2018-05-10 14:38:31	s1zZLe	there are racist people out there, but it's because they're ignorant morons.  Not because that's how white people are taught to be by white america.
2018-05-10 14:38:39	@prence	I do but that's because I'm a history junkie :\
2018-05-10 14:38:45	@prence	well it's not a taught thing
2018-05-10 14:39:01	s1zZLe	we hear about high statistics of black crime, so we are afraid of black guys in hoodies
2018-05-10 14:39:02	@prence	it's a thing that has been sort of inter-weaved in the culture
2018-05-10 14:39:03	s1zZLe	basically
2018-05-10 14:39:15	@prence	in a way, yeah
2018-05-10 14:39:28	@prence	but I'm 1000% more afraid of a white tweaker
2018-05-10 14:39:34	s1zZLe	either way, i don't think it justifies all the racism toward white people either
2018-05-10 14:39:49	s1zZLe	a lot of people seem to think that other ethnicities get a free pass to generalise and treat all white people like shit
2018-05-10 14:40:00	s1zZLe	because of the ignorant minority of white people who are actually ignorant shmucks
2018-05-10 14:40:28	@prence	well I don't agree with that either but I at least see where they're coming from whereas "all blacks are criminals" is kind of a mindfuck to me
2018-05-10 14:40:42	s1zZLe	i don't know anyone who believes that though
2018-05-10 14:40:42	@prence	or all criminals are PoC
2018-05-10 14:40:44	@prence	whatever
2018-05-10 14:40:50	@prence	I do haha
2018-05-10 14:41:02	@prence	pretty much the majority of the southern US
2018-05-10 14:41:03	s1zZLe	then you know some ignorant fucks
2018-05-10 14:41:08	@prence	yep
2018-05-10 14:41:31	s1zZLe	i guess it's different depending on region
2018-05-10 14:41:33	@prence	I've told the story before but I had a gun stuck in my mouth when I lived in arkansas because I told a "friend" not to call PoC niggers
2018-05-10 14:41:45	s1zZLe	wow
2018-05-10 14:41:50	s1zZLe	that's some redneck shit
2018-05-10 14:41:51	@prence	and none of my "friends" stuck up for me or said shit
2018-05-10 14:41:53	@prence	yeah
2018-05-10 14:41:55	@prence	100%
2018-05-10 14:42:18	s1zZLe	i mean, i live amongst the canadian version of rednecks and experience similar ignorance, but we dont have guns to put in each others mouths
2018-05-10 14:42:19	s1zZLe	but still
2018-05-10 14:42:20	@prence	the irony is that he was listening to three six mafia and showing off his new stereo 
2018-05-10 14:42:50	@prence	yeah I just don't get it
2018-05-10 14:43:14	@prence	that's why I left the south (among other reasons, mostly religion)
2018-05-10 14:43:44	@prence	want to make a friend or get a job? go to church!
2018-05-10 14:43:46	@prence	nothx
2018-05-10 14:43:52	s1zZLe	i think people just approach the whole thing wrong.  the core issue isn't really racism, or what one ethnicity thinks about another.  The core issues at play are severe ignorance, and the generally shitty underbelly that exposes itself admist such ignorance.
2018-05-10 14:44:07	@prence	when I first moved there, I spent 2 years going to bible study to try and make friends
2018-05-10 14:44:17	s1zZLe	fuck
2018-05-10 14:44:21	s1zZLe	that
2018-05-10 14:44:22	@prence	s1zZLe, well yeah, it's always about ignorance haha
2018-05-10 14:44:46	s1zZLe	but the response to white people acting racist (ie: ignorance) is often black people acting racist (ie: more ignorance)
2018-05-10 14:44:59	s1zZLe	so i don't give a fuck bout none of those ign'ant fucks
2018-05-10 14:45:03	s1zZLe	is all im tryna say
2018-05-10 14:45:08	s1zZLe	ya'hurrmeh?
2018-05-10 14:45:24	@prence	I went to a wedding of this girl I went to school with, she was black, and I was like "oh man, this might be crazy!" but it was just a normal fucking wedding
2018-05-10 14:45:33	s1zZLe	of course
2018-05-10 14:45:36	s1zZLe	becuase they're just normal fucking people
2018-05-10 14:45:36	@prence	that's when I was like "oh, nothing is REALLY different"
2018-05-10 14:45:40	@prence	exactly
2018-05-10 14:45:54	Elfeckin	no was was getting "crunk"
2018-05-10 14:45:57	@prence	I expected some tyler perry type shit 
2018-05-10 14:46:00	@prence	well I mean
2018-05-10 14:46:08	@prence	I lived outside memphis so EVERYONE was getting crunk
2018-05-10 14:46:22	@prence	you can't just ignore the subculture
2018-05-10 14:46:41	Elfeckin	and jimmy, unless you live in the south,. you cant really grasp the blatant.. BLATANT rascism down here
2018-05-10 14:46:43	@prence	I've seen 36 mafia in concert about 10 times
2018-05-10 14:46:53	@prence	that's 100% true
2018-05-10 14:46:54	s1zZLe	i experienced numerous things that made me realise how similar we all are despite our perceived differences.  I spent 3 years in montreal where I became good friends with a lot of indian and arab people, as well as russian, ukranian, polish, belgian, etc.  Various cultures.
2018-05-10 14:46:58	@prence	it's alarming heh
2018-05-10 14:47:06	s1zZLe	And i'm a naive but curious person who asks questions without inhibition about it.

2018-05-10 14:47:21	s1zZLe	and spending time with them and their families, you realise it's a lot like it is with our families.
2018-05-10 14:47:25	s1zZLe	it's all just people being people

2018-05-11 13:29:36	s1zZLe	generally, if the creator is like "im over this and want to do something else" it's a pretty good reason to just end the show
2018-05-11 13:29:41	s1zZLe	wouldn't be the same with anyone but andy
2018-05-11 13:29:47	s1zZLe	i used to hate andy samberg but that show made me love him

2018-05-30 16:45:55	@prence	haha
2018-05-30 16:46:10	@prence	alright, lets see if you can figure this out (or anyone else)
2018-05-30 16:46:24	@prence	I did some win10 updates 2 days ago and I can't get sound anymore, front or back jack
2018-05-30 16:46:35	@prence	but if I plug in my xbox controller, I can get sound through USB
2018-05-30 16:46:52	@prence	I checked all settings, it should be coming out of the speakers 
2018-05-30 16:47:13	@prence	could it be a coincidence that my onboard sound card died at the same time as the updates? I don't feel like it
2018-05-30 16:47:29	@prence	I checked the drivers, updated them, no dice, rolled them back, no dice
2018-05-30 16:48:04	philsabot	weird
2018-05-30 16:48:36	@prence	if I have sound playing, windows shows it as playing
2018-05-30 16:48:40	@prence	it's just not coming out
2018-05-30 16:48:46	@prence	tried headphones on both jacks, etc
2018-05-30 16:48:57	@prence	my speakers work with my phone so it's not them either
2018-05-30 16:49:46	philsabot	so the little time ticker moves as the song plays?

2018-05-30 16:51:55	@prence	all windows sound settings work, I triple checked it wasn't trying to do some HDMI audio output
2018-05-30 16:51:56	@prence	nope :\
2018-05-30 16:52:24	philsabot	doubt it died because of an update
2018-05-30 16:52:34	philsabot	rollback windows
2018-05-30 16:53:03	philsabot	maybe take a photo of all current sound settings for reference

2018-08-24 15:39:07	s1zZLe	following this: http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/windows-10/has-your-windows-10-start-menu-stopped-working-here-are-four-ways-to-fix-it-11364000314532
2018-08-24 15:39:23	s1zZLe	i get issues and error messages where that article seems to think it should fix shit
2018-08-24 15:39:35	s1zZLe	not sure why suddenly windows is broken and it basically looks like i need to reinstall
2018-08-24 15:39:38	zzzeyez	did you restart?
2018-08-24 15:40:29	s1zZLe	yes
2018-08-24 15:40:35	zzzeyez	maybe do system restore
2018-08-24 15:40:45	s1zZLe	i haven't set a restore point for a long time
2018-08-24 15:40:48	s1zZLe	if ever
2018-08-24 15:40:53	zzzeyez	same
2018-08-24 15:40:54	Elfeckin	i disable system restore
2018-08-24 15:40:55	s1zZLe	nope never
2018-08-24 15:40:59	zzzeyez	i'm sure it's fixable
2018-08-24 15:41:06	s1zZLe	yeah trying ot find ways
2018-08-24 15:41:12	s1zZLe	but im not even sure how to explain the problem
2018-08-24 15:41:17	s1zZLe	just "suddenly shit started going wrong"
2018-08-24 15:41:21	s1zZLe	i mean, i was watching porn on xvideos
2018-08-24 15:41:23	zzzeyez	is there a #windows channel on freenode or something?
2018-08-24 15:41:25	s1zZLe	but pretty sure thats a legit site
2018-08-24 15:41:34	zzzeyez	xvideos is fine for me idk
2018-08-24 15:42:11	s1zZLe	my pc has been acting weird the past few weeks tho
2018-08-24 15:42:19	s1zZLe	one time i got home from work and it was at a black screen 
2018-08-24 15:42:23	@prence	what's file explorer show and what starts up on boot?
2018-08-24 15:42:31	s1zZLe	with the "no boot device, press f1 to try again or f2 to enter setup"
2018-08-24 15:42:38	s1zZLe	f1 would just make it repeat the msg (indicating boot failure)
2018-08-24 15:42:48	zzzeyez	almost seems like ssd failing
2018-08-24 15:42:50	s1zZLe	but a hard boot always got past it
2018-08-24 15:42:56	@prence	I get that constantly and it's cause my ssd is dying
2018-08-24 15:42:57	zzzeyez	oo nvm
2018-08-24 15:42:58	@prence	yeah zzzeyez 
2018-08-24 15:43:12	@prence	i can go into boot settings and it gets past it
2018-08-24 15:43:24	s1zZLe	sooooo what's the fix?
2018-08-24 15:43:28	s1zZLe	buy a new ssd and reinstall windows?
2018-08-24 15:43:32	Elfeckin	burn it
2018-08-24 15:43:33	@prence	does it click?
2018-08-24 15:43:39	@prence	when you reboot
2018-08-24 15:43:47	s1zZLe	not that i can hear no
2018-08-24 15:43:58	s1zZLe	only thing i ever hear is the fan
2018-08-24 15:44:05	Elfeckin	wurrrrr
2018-08-24 15:44:06	@prence	it's possible you have something that has changed your boot order
2018-08-24 15:44:12	@prence	have you checked that out in your bios?
2018-08-24 15:44:20	zzzeyez	that wouldn't effect his start menu though
2018-08-24 15:44:23	s1zZLe	yeah, its still set to boot from my primary drive
2018-08-24 15:44:31	s1zZLe	and yeah i was gonna say that zzzeyez 
2018-08-24 15:44:37	@prence	it would if it went to a fucked up partition 
2018-08-24 15:44:43	zzzeyez	true
2018-08-24 15:44:45	@prence	like if that partition was default
2018-08-24 15:44:48	s1zZLe	i don't know if it's relevent, but last night when i was in bed, I got 4 email notifcations that someone was trying to login to my battlenet acct
2018-08-24 15:44:53	s1zZLe	i changed the password today though
2018-08-24 15:44:55	s1zZLe	but like

2018-08-24 19:06:09	s1zZLe	no i dont think so
2018-08-24 19:06:22	s1zZLe	plus i did scans with malwarebytes and bitdefender
2018-08-24 19:16:12	zzzeyez1	you think it's your ssd?
2018-08-24 19:16:19	zzzeyez1	ssd's are pretty bad regarding rewrites
2018-08-24 19:17:07	zzzeyez1	big part of why people are no longer using swap disks (plus we have so much ram now)
2018-08-24 19:17:58	s1zZLe	i don't know what much of that means :/
2018-08-24 19:18:24	s1zZLe	i don't know anything.. i described the issues im having to a gamer nerd on quakenet that i talk to sometimes and he said it sounds like ssd is dying
2018-08-24 19:18:26	s1zZLe	also prence said that
2018-08-24 19:18:46	@prence	that's my diagnosis :\
2018-08-24 19:19:46	zzzeyez1	only one way to tell
2018-08-24 19:19:55	zzzeyez1	the water trick
2018-08-24 19:25:32	s1zZLe	should i put butter on it first?
2018-08-24 19:25:35	s1zZLe	then put it on the stove?
2018-08-24 19:27:51	zzzeyez1	do you think that like
2018-08-24 19:28:01	zzzeyez1	if you put all your memories on your ssd and then weight it
2018-08-24 19:28:09	zzzeyez1	will it weight any differently than it did when you bought it
2018-08-24 19:35:33	s1zZLe	well lets see
2018-08-24 19:35:42	s1zZLe	do ssd's weigh more when you store normal information on them?
2018-08-24 19:36:01	s1zZLe	your question is really two questions
2018-08-24 19:36:17	s1zZLe	a.) does storing information of ANY kind on an SSD change its weight?
2018-08-24 19:36:39	@prence	no
2018-08-24 19:36:42	s1zZLe	b.) are memories ever going to be able to be transfered as bits of information?
2018-08-24 19:36:49	@prence	who knows
2018-08-24 19:37:04	s1zZLe	c.) was this a stupid conversation?
2018-08-24 19:37:11	@prence	yes
2018-08-24 19:37:16	@prence	lol
2018-08-24 19:37:16	s1zZLe	d.) was this stupid conversation caused by a stupid question?
2018-08-24 19:37:17	zzzeyez1	i mean i always wake up with cell phone pictures of shit i don't remember
2018-08-24 19:37:27	zzzeyez1	so yes you can store memories digitally!
2018-08-24 19:37:41	s1zZLe	yeah but you drink a lot and do drugs so that's probably just part & parcel with the freebird life
2018-08-24 19:37:55	s1zZLe	those are photographs of memories
2018-08-24 19:37:57	s1zZLe	not actual memories
2018-08-24 19:38:00	zzzeyez1	i think there's correlation between bad memory and intelligence
2018-08-24 19:38:19	s1zZLe	well there are different levels, layers, and categories of intelligence
2018-08-24 19:38:20	zzzeyez1	and every time we access a memory we rewrite it
2018-08-24 19:38:30	s1zZLe	well yes there's that theory
2018-08-24 19:38:37	zzzeyez1	interesting that you'd say "layers"
2018-08-24 19:38:42	s1zZLe	everytime we remember a memory, we rewrite it and it slightly changes over time
2018-08-24 19:38:43	zzzeyez1	i'm going to steal that thankj you
2018-08-24 19:39:03	zzzeyez1	yep yep i really try to just fabricate my memories now
2018-08-24 19:39:10	s1zZLe	i equate intelligence to conscioussness, in terms of the layers thing
2018-08-24 19:39:13	zzzeyez1	my brain is getting messy i don't know what's going on anymore
2018-08-24 19:39:22	s1zZLe	oh really?
2018-08-24 19:39:24	s1zZLe	you don't say
2018-08-24 19:39:26	zzzeyez1	hmm
2018-08-24 19:39:51	zzzeyez1	do you think less-intelligent people have less conciousness?
2018-08-24 19:40:08	s1zZLe	i think so
2018-08-24 19:40:14	s1zZLe	i've met some people who barely seem consciously
2018-08-24 19:40:16	s1zZLe	*conscious
2018-08-24 19:40:31	s1zZLe	literally only awake enough to complete normal functions and have shallow short conversations of small talk
2018-08-24 19:40:43	s1zZLe	no depth, no layers
2018-08-24 19:40:47	zzzeyez1	ok i guess i can see where your coming from yeah
2018-08-24 19:40:49	zzzeyez1	makes sense
2018-08-24 19:40:49	s1zZLe	just impulse reactions to stimuli
2018-08-24 19:41:15	zzzeyez1	wow
2018-08-24 19:41:24	zzzeyez1	you're on a roll with the wordings
2018-08-24 19:41:44	zzzeyez1	i guess that really is all dumb people are: impulse reactions to stimuli
2018-08-24 19:41:53	s1zZLe	for the most part
2018-08-24 19:42:01	zzzeyez1	like an insect!
2018-08-24 19:42:15	s1zZLe	i dunno
2018-08-24 19:42:23	s1zZLe	we're speaking in very broad strokes here
2018-08-24 19:42:43	zzzeyez1	well language was never good at communicating about conciousness
2018-08-24 19:42:50	zzzeyez1	actually we don't even know wtf conciousness is
2018-08-24 19:42:54	s1zZLe	i like to think even people who seem super dumb have some sort of internal depth to them..  it's just not in a place where they can access it in a way where they can find words to express it
2018-08-24 19:43:08	zzzeyez1	i think so too
2018-08-24 19:43:16	zzzeyez1	but
2018-08-24 19:43:23	zzzeyez1	internal depth = introspection?
2018-08-24 19:43:33	zzzeyez1	and can you be smart w/o introspection?
2018-08-24 19:43:40	s1zZLe	or analysis
2018-08-24 19:44:11	zzzeyez1	nature made conciousness just so it could think about itself, how selfish
2018-08-24 19:44:43	s1zZLe	i pretend we're all kind of bubbles of the same conscioussness pond
2018-08-24 19:44:47	s1zZLe	or whatever
2018-08-24 19:45:01	zzzeyez1	yeah i like to think so too
2018-08-24 19:45:15	s1zZLe	some of us can feel it, but no one can really articulate it or visualise it
2018-08-24 19:45:16	zzzeyez1	dude did i tell you my dream
2018-08-24 19:45:30	zzzeyez1	get this!!
2018-08-24 19:46:42	s1zZLe	haven't heard it
2018-08-24 19:46:42	s1zZLe	go
2018-08-24 19:46:52	zzzeyez1	i start in a room with pedestals that have tarot cards on them.  i'm scared to look at the tarot cards.  next i'm in a waiting room of sorts and i realize i'm dreaming (lucid) so i shake this plastic sheet between me and reality (it's super floppy) and then i blast upwards into this like, there was no visuals, i was just swimming through this rly human feeling place and i start hearing static inside my head
2018-08-24 19:46:54	s1zZLe	press enter sometime soon, remember irc cuts you off
2018-08-24 19:47:07	zzzeyez1	so i get scared because i think i'm dying and i end the dream and it took like
2018-08-24 19:47:17	zzzeyez1	1.5 seconds and i think i felt myself entering my bdy
2018-08-24 19:47:18	zzzeyez1	body
2018-08-24 19:47:24	zzzeyez1	it was the weirdest experience of my life maybe
2018-08-24 19:47:25	s1zZLe	dude
2018-08-24 19:47:38	s1zZLe	you've seen it then
2018-08-24 19:47:44	zzzeyez1	lucid dreaming is fucking SICK!  try some abstract shit if you ever get a chance in the lucid dream
2018-08-24 19:48:04	s1zZLe	i almost burst through but then i got excited and woke up
2018-08-24 19:48:14	zzzeyez1	it's so hard not to
2018-08-24 19:48:17	s1zZLe	but what you just described sounds similar to my salvia trip
2018-08-24 19:48:29	zzzeyez1	this is the furthest i ever took a lucid dream
2018-08-24 19:48:34	zzzeyez1	my first one turned into a wet dream lol
2018-08-24 19:48:35	s1zZLe	were you sleeping or like.. passed out?
2018-08-24 19:49:06	zzzeyez1	ok i fell asleep rly drunk, woke up after 6 hours with probably no REM sleep.. felt rly tired.. drank a beer and a coffee, and fell back asleep
2018-08-24 19:49:14	zzzeyez1	it happened about 30 min into my sleep
2018-08-24 19:49:39	s1zZLe	crazy
2018-08-24 19:49:48	s1zZLe	i used to try and train myself to have lucid dream
2018-08-24 19:49:49	s1zZLe	s
2018-08-24 19:49:54	s1zZLe	came sooo close
2018-08-24 19:49:56	s1zZLe	but always got too excited
2018-08-24 19:50:18	zzzeyez1	yeah most people do, i have done that for like half of my lucid dreams
2018-08-24 19:50:19	s1zZLe	i had some when i was a kid but didn't really know how awesome it was
2018-08-24 19:50:56	zzzeyez1	a previous lucid dream was similar
2018-08-24 19:51:05	zzzeyez1	it was like, i was in a grocery store and realized i was dreaming
2018-08-24 19:51:12	zzzeyez1	so i tried to turn it into a nightmare
2018-08-24 19:51:24	zzzeyez1	and it didn't work, it just made everyone like ragdolls

2018-08-27 17:36:23	zzzeyez	looks good s1zZLe 
2018-08-27 17:36:28	shaan	though s1zZLe still uses windows for some reason
2018-08-27 17:36:46	zzzeyez	woah this is my first time hearing of darktable
2018-08-27 17:36:49	s1zZLe	dude im too dumb for linux
2018-08-27 17:36:54	zzzeyez	is this new?
2018-08-27 17:37:01	shaan	s1zZLe its not 1995
2018-08-27 17:37:17	zzzeyez	my ex gf used linux without issues, i think she still does

2018-08-27 17:37:53	shaan	its not even a thing you need to think about anymore 
2018-08-27 17:37:54	zzzeyez	isn't valve releasing all their games on linux now?

2018-08-27 17:38:36	shaan	i dont think so zzzeyez 
2018-08-27 17:38:40	zzzeyez	it's a program where you hit ctrl+space to search through apps and files (like spotlight on macos)
2018-08-27 17:39:06	s1zZLe	sure, you guys probably setup these things for your people and get all the drivers set and shit
2018-08-27 17:39:14	shaan	s1zZLe: no
2018-08-27 17:39:14	s1zZLe	i like how with windows, you just install it and it finds all the drivers for you
2018-08-27 17:39:22	s1zZLe	no fucking command line bullshit just to get your sound working

2018-08-27 17:40:12	s1zZLe	so you're saying it should be as easy as throwing ubuntu on a thumbdrive, and i should be chatting with you guys on my new OS in like 10 minutes?

2018-08-27 18:16:57	Boobies	shit happens
2018-08-27 18:17:10	nayt	i think there's this conscious effort to fart though 
2018-08-27 18:17:16	nayt	it's like a territorial thing
2018-08-27 18:17:21	zzzeyez	yeah definitely
2018-08-27 18:17:24	nayt	YES I AM HERE. I AM PEEING.
2018-08-27 18:17:39	Boobies	not in my case
2018-08-27 18:17:45	Boobies	I just refuse to poop in public
2018-08-27 18:17:48	Boobies	so sometimes things build up[
2018-08-27 18:17:49	zzzeyez	i'm probably annoying in public restrooms in that i take my time in the stall waiting for people to leave so i can crack open a beer
2018-08-27 18:18:13	zzzeyez	my ex gf was weary of public restrooms so she didn't poop for like 4days
2018-08-27 18:18:16	zzzeyez	and it got so backed up
2018-08-27 18:18:22	zzzeyez	she had to get laxatives and stuff
2018-08-27 18:18:31	Boobies	I poop nightly 
2018-08-27 18:18:35	Boobies	sometimes morning and night
2018-08-27 18:18:37	zzzeyez	but i poop at 8am every days
2018-08-27 18:18:38	Boobies	but never in public
2018-08-27 18:18:57	nayt	why not in public
2018-08-27 18:19:01	nayt	do you poop at work?
2018-08-27 18:19:07	Boobies	weird anxiety

2018-08-27 19:06:15	zzzeyez	and i did it in the snow once while my mom was gone
2018-08-27 19:06:23	zzzeyez	and she came back and saw the foot prints so i got busted

2018-08-27 19:10:13	s1zZLe	I jumped off the shed and my knee landed first but the snow pile didn't cushion me at all
2018-08-27 19:10:37	s1zZLe	went through to hit a concrete slab that was used for the clothesline pole (the pole was no longer there, but the concrete still was)
2018-08-27 19:10:49	s1zZLe	mangled my shit up, couldn't walk for a couple weeks
2018-08-27 19:10:58	s1zZLe	but had x-rays and the doctor said there was no bone damage ora nything

2018-08-27 19:11:08	s1zZLe	years later, i still had a lump and could feel shit moving around under my skins on my kneecap
2018-08-27 19:11:09	zzzeyez	knee damage is the worst
2018-08-27 19:11:20	s1zZLe	eventually it got really irritated and i would always scratch it
2018-08-27 19:11:29	s1zZLe	eventually, the skin opened up and i could see something dark inside my skin
2018-08-27 19:11:39	zzzeyez	fucking gnarly
2018-08-27 19:11:46	s1zZLe	so I bought some rubbing alcohol, iodyne, and razor blades
2018-08-27 19:11:51	s1zZLe	and cut out a piece of a beer bottle from my knee
2018-08-27 19:11:56	s1zZLe	EIGHT YEARS LATER

2018-09-25 14:40:19	zzzeyez	some key techniques for me have been a) imagine a scenario very vividly while falling asleep, b) check light switches and clocks to see if they function, if they don't then you're dreaming, c) wake up in the middle of the night and go back to bed, typically it happens when i fall back asleep
2018-09-25 14:40:43	zzzeyez	but often i have not very much control.  sometimes i can control shit to an insane degree

2018-09-27 13:16:55	zzzeyez1	i mean even when i'm sober i believe in multiple realities, it's pretty plausible considering the state of quantum studies (how could you not)
2018-09-27 13:17:31	zzzeyez1	and also that i'm not suffering because i'm pretty happy, i got drunk and cried about dying in another reality , so what

2018-09-27 13:28:43	@prence	I really don't understand the alpha/beta shit, we're all tetris pieces, someone fits somewhere

2018-10-18 21:30:26	orngemnth	Compared to Game of Thrones maybe.
2018-10-18 21:30:46	orngemnth	It's a very 1970's conspiracy movie type show.
2018-10-18 21:30:50	s1zZLe	compared to anything post-1998

2018-10-26 12:00:02	orngemnth	Also, mosquitoes usually feed at dawn and dusk when the wind tends to die down and the humidity rises, Day explains. If you can stay indoors at those times, you’ll avoid bites. A good fan pointed in your general vicinity will also do a great job of keeping the bugs away. “Mosquitoes can’t fly in a breeze faster than 1 mile per hour,” Day says.  - So the reference to the Type O Negative cover of Summer Breeze holds up!

2018-10-26 19:12:36	@s1zZLe	welp, i just got banned from a wrestling discord for calling them all autistic for buying $800 WWE replica belts

2018-10-26 19:12:43	@prence	lol
2018-10-26 19:13:10	@s1zZLe	sometimes i forget the demographic of people who actually watch and follow wrestling
2018-10-26 19:14:07	@prence	I don't
2018-10-26 19:14:09	@prence	you and Elfeckin 
2018-10-26 19:14:31	@s1zZLe	moments like this make me really question my self-perception
2018-10-26 19:14:38	@s1zZLe	maybe i'm one of those autistic weeaboos and just don't know it
2018-10-26 19:14:49	@prence	lol
2018-10-26 19:14:55	@prence	I mean, maybe
2018-10-26 19:15:03	@prence	at least you'd be self-aware
2018-10-26 19:15:40	@s1zZLe	i wonder if...
2018-10-26 19:16:14	@s1zZLe	when people reflect on themselves, does everything think "i'm reasonably sane and intelligent, empathetic and caring"
2018-10-26 19:16:34	@s1zZLe	like.. do dumb people KNOW they're different from other people?
2018-10-26 19:17:12	@prence	not in my experience
2018-10-26 19:17:17	@s1zZLe	uh h
2018-10-26 19:17:18	orngemnth	Psychopaths don't worry about the empathetic/caring parts.  And I think moderate dummies kinda know it.
2018-10-26 19:17:21	@s1zZLe	*uh oh
2018-10-26 19:17:22	@prence	I've met some fucking idiots that thought they were normal
2018-10-26 19:17:41	@prence	well psychopaths/sociopaths are kinda different
2018-10-26 19:17:58	orngemnth	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect  There's this too.
2018-10-26 19:18:00	orngemnth	0.0.
2018-10-26 19:18:13	@prence	yeah
2018-10-26 19:18:29	orngemnth	The 0.0. is where you drop your BT speaker on your keyboard.
2018-10-26 19:18:31	@s1zZLe	well shit
2018-10-26 19:18:32	@s1zZLe	i'm fucked
2018-10-26 19:18:33	@prence	that's how trump was elected
2018-10-26 19:19:33	orngemnth	I'm still in shock that he was elected and that I bought a BT speaker called OontZ.
2018-10-26 19:19:37	@s1zZLe	man
2018-10-26 19:19:40	@s1zZLe	this just made me really sad
2018-10-26 19:19:49	@s1zZLe	pretty sure i'm actually so dumb that i don't know how dumb i am
2018-10-26 19:19:54	orngemnth	It's actually a pretty good speaker.
2018-10-26 19:19:59	@s1zZLe	like.. under-estimated the difference between myself and average people
2018-10-26 19:20:05	@prence	OONTZ OONTZ OONTZ OONTZ
2018-10-26 19:20:23	@prence	s1zZLe, the fact that you're questioning it, puts you at least one level up
2018-10-26 19:21:02	orngemnth	s1zZLe is so smart he voted for Trudeau.

2018-10-26 19:38:31	@prence	mostly cause they won't remember the joke
2018-10-26 19:38:33	@s1zZLe	so i started asking like "i don't get it.  what's the point of these belts?"
2018-10-26 19:38:36	@prence	but also cause it's a little cruel
2018-10-26 19:38:38	@s1zZLe	"do you feel like the champ?"
2018-10-26 19:38:50	@prence	when do they wear them?

2018-10-26 19:39:10	@s1zZLe	and i think that's when I said "for autistic people"

2019-02-06 22:24:48	s1zZLe	the AN rule
2019-02-06 22:25:09	s1zZLe	Use an when the indefinite article comes before a word beginning with a vowel sound:

2019-02-06 22:25:24	s1zZLe	except for H words

2019-02-06 22:27:46	ovns	I have a legit opinion here - we agree to pronounce everything the way UK does, but spell everything American.
2019-02-06 22:27:52	s1zZLe	was it given to you by the lady who talks to you and writes words down with a pencil in her notebook?
2019-02-06 22:28:02	s1zZLe	uhh
2019-02-06 22:28:08	s1zZLe	no your opinion is wrong

2019-02-06 22:28:31	s1zZLe	oh wait i misread
2019-02-06 22:28:34	ovns	Yeah, we wouldn't do stuipid shit like that.
2019-02-06 22:28:35	s1zZLe	but no
2019-02-06 22:28:42	s1zZLe	because colour is spelled like this
2019-02-06 22:28:43	s1zZLe	colour
2019-02-06 22:28:50	ovns	I'm willing to sahy schedule the silly way.
2019-02-06 22:28:50	s1zZLe	not the lazy american way
2019-02-06 22:29:05	ovns	Yeah, the color thing is a non-starter.
2019-02-06 22:29:12	s1zZLe	"oh know yall them words haves too much letters in'em fer me to 'member"
2019-02-06 22:29:18	s1zZLe	*oh no
2019-02-06 22:29:49	s1zZLe	in 50 years american-english will no longer contain vowels or punctuation
2019-02-06 22:29:49	ovns	The U makes no sense there - Webster nixxed that shit like 150 years ago.
2019-02-06 22:29:56	s1zZLe	just lower case consonants and emojis
2019-02-06 22:30:14	ovns	Hebrew has no vowels in it and we give those fuckers 5 billion a year.
2019-02-06 22:30:28	s1zZLe	that's just compensation for...

2019-02-14 16:09:02	s1zZLe	i sometimes regret walking away that day
2019-02-14 16:10:53	@prence	eh, regrets are worthless, learn from the experience instead
2019-02-14 16:10:58	@prence	you were both probably young and stupid
2019-02-14 16:11:28	s1zZLe	yeah definitely
2019-02-14 16:11:36	s1zZLe	i was also 3 years older than her
2019-02-14 16:11:55	s1zZLe	not a big deal but the difference between 18 and 21 can be huge
2019-02-14 16:12:06	s1zZLe	in terms of mindset
2019-02-14 16:12:22	s1zZLe	who knows, if we stayed together, maybe we both would've just been useless pots and she wouldn't have gotten her shit together to become who she is
2019-02-14 16:18:34	@prence	heh probably, 18 year olds are pretty dumb so maybe that relationship made her re-think being an asshole
2019-02-14 16:18:41	myr	I mean, just because she's nice in general doesn't mean she's not horrible to people she dates
2019-02-14 16:18:49	myr	I've known plenty of people like that
2019-02-14 16:19:41	myr	after ex and I split pretty much none of our old friends ever talked to me again but he's still best buddies with them and he was an abusive piece of shit
2019-02-14 16:19:45	myr	not that they ever saw it
2019-02-14 16:20:01	@prence	how old was he tho?
2019-02-14 16:20:05	@prence	old dogs/new tricks and whatnot
2019-02-14 16:20:08	myr	20s
2019-02-14 16:20:39	myr	nah, I read a thing his current? girlfriend posted and he's still up to the same shit in his 40s now
2019-02-14 16:21:07	@prence	:\ that's pretty shitty
2019-02-14 16:21:11	myr	convinced everyone about how poor pitiful him he was and they all shut her out when she said anything about him being a douchebag
2019-02-14 16:21:22	@prence	he just has no personal growth in that case
2019-02-14 16:21:23	myr	I refrained from saying I told you so
2019-02-14 16:22:16	myr	my only point was that just because she got her life together that doesn't mean she ever learned/decided to treat partners well
2019-02-14 16:22:17	@prence	I would rather err on the side of people CAN change
2019-02-14 16:22:24	@prence	true
2019-02-14 16:22:29	myr	they can, but I wouldn't regret leaving that situation
2019-02-14 16:22:37	myr	because you can hope all you want but that doesn't mean it'll ever happen
2019-02-14 16:22:50	@prence	absolutely
2019-02-14 16:23:00	@prence	he said they'd become useless pots (?!) and I'd agree 
2019-02-14 16:23:17	@prence	maybe she didn't learn but fucking up is part of the process
2019-02-14 16:25:43	s1zZLe	i just figured out how to explain my mind
2019-02-14 16:25:44	s1zZLe	or like
2019-02-14 16:25:45	s1zZLe	k so
2019-02-14 16:26:32	s1zZLe	i have this constant issue where i feel like i'm dissociated from myself, and playing my life like a video game.  But i often convince myself that i hate myself, so I purposely do things to sabotage myself
2019-02-14 16:26:44	s1zZLe	what kind of personality disorder is that?
2019-02-14 16:27:16	s1zZLe	kinda like when you start playing GTA and wanna focus on the storyline and missions, but then get bored so you start shooting random strangers and making the cops chase you
2019-02-14 16:27:26	s1zZLe	then you die and realize you forgot to save for like 4 hours
2019-02-14 16:27:29	s1zZLe	^^^^^^^^^thats my life
2019-02-14 16:27:53	@prence	millenialism
2019-02-14 16:28:24	s1zZLe	really?
2019-02-14 16:28:32	s1zZLe	i doubt generation has anything to do with it
2019-02-14 16:30:34	@prence	nah just generalizing because you said video games and GTA
2019-02-14 16:32:20	@prence	if I was an armchair psychologist or psychiatrist I'd say MPD
2019-02-14 16:38:38	s1zZLe	?

2019-02-14 16:40:25	@prence	it doesn't mean that you think you're different people like it implies
2019-02-14 16:40:31	@prence	moreso that you're on the outside of your life looking in
2019-02-14 16:43:36	s1zZLe	at times
2019-02-14 16:43:43	s1zZLe	especially when i'm emotionally frazzled
2019-02-14 16:44:02	s1zZLe	example, if i sense that someone is trying to test me, i'll purposely do the opposite of what i think they want
2019-02-14 16:44:08	s1zZLe	as like a "fuck you for testing me"
2019-02-14 16:44:18	s1zZLe	but at the same time, that results in people have a bad perception of you lol
2019-02-14 16:44:21	s1zZLe	RIP

2019-02-15 13:58:24	@prence	I would probably be disappointed
2019-02-15 13:58:32	@prence	I want some delicious slimy oyster meat, not this dumb rock
2019-02-15 13:58:57	zzzeyez	was it you who said you don't eat eggs sunny-side-up because you dislike embryonic fluid
2019-02-15 13:59:24	@prence	nope
2019-02-15 13:59:36	zzzeyez	oic.  i love slimy foods

2019-02-15 14:01:49	@prence	the only seafood/fish/crustacean/whatever I don't like is salmon and catfish
2019-02-15 14:02:20	@prence	when I was in china they baked a whole fish and because I was the guest they served me the eyeball

2019-02-15 14:04:03	zzzeyez	only seafood i'm iffy about is tilapia 
2019-02-15 14:04:19	@prence	I saw someone talking about how tilapia is raised really poorly
2019-02-15 14:04:28	@prence	and "if you saw how they raise it, you'd never eat it again"
2019-02-15 14:04:28	zzzeyez	they are fed their own shit sometimes
2019-02-15 14:04:33	@prence	ahhh fuck
2019-02-15 14:04:38	@prence	well that's why lol
2019-02-15 14:04:47	zzzeyez	ya china massproduces the fuck out of tilapia
2019-02-15 14:04:59	@prence	I can't taste it in tilapia like I can with catfish 
2019-02-15 14:05:05	@prence	well better than emptying the oceans I guess
2019-02-15 14:05:27	zzzeyez	i mean oysters are bottom-feeders too
2019-02-15 14:05:39	@prence	true
2019-02-15 14:05:42	zzzeyez	so maybe it's hypocritical of me, i haven't had catfish in a long time though
2019-02-15 14:05:51	zzzeyez	huge fan of salmon and salmon skin though
2019-02-15 14:06:11	@prence	I love salmon skin (and most skin on fish, especially trout mmm)
2019-02-15 14:06:16	@prence	but the meat just tastes weird to me
2019-02-15 14:06:25	zzzeyez	hmm i haven't had trout skin i don't think
2019-02-15 14:07:27	@prence	you should try it sometime, it's like salmon but a little thinner so it has a nice crunch from being cooked
2019-02-15 14:07:40	@prence	it's so fucking expensive tho
2019-02-15 14:10:04	zzzeyez	people catch it fishing here lots i think it's common
2019-02-15 14:10:11	zzzeyez	i never seen it at a store
2019-02-15 14:12:53	@prence	I've seen rainbow trout at the store but it's always been pricey
2019-02-15 14:13:12	@prence	or more pricey than going to a restaurant in oregon colorado or alaska

2019-02-16 12:00:43	s1zZLe	improve your life and try to improve as a person to feel whole, rather than seek the ideal relationship that you think will "complete" you

2019-02-23 09:17:50	+nance	s1zZLe: i'm not very good at it
2019-02-23 09:17:52	zzzeyez	i reformat constantly and just import my config files
2019-02-23 09:17:59	+nance	but just install it and throw yourself into it.
2019-02-23 09:18:01	+nance	you'll learn a lot
2019-02-23 09:18:02	zzzeyez	even if i fucked up my shit, my configs are all on github anyways so
2019-02-23 09:18:02	+shaan	i might need to reinstall 
2019-02-23 09:18:10	+nance	that's another good reason to get a vps because it makes you learn the command line
2019-02-23 09:18:10	s1zZLe	dude any time i try to dual boot, i fuck shit up on my hdd
2019-02-23 09:18:12	+shaan	i cant connect to the internet for like 2 minutes on wake frop sleep 
2019-02-23 09:18:17	s1zZLe	somehow end up with partitions that i can't access from either os
2019-02-23 09:18:24	+shaan	s1zZLe: who said dual boot
2019-02-23 09:18:25	+nance	i dual boot debian and macos on one of my machines
2019-02-23 09:18:36	+nance	but before that i'd just been running ubuntu for like 10 years
2019-02-23 09:18:52	zzzeyez	some ppl have issues dual booting.  i have had partitions randomly deleted, i personally wouldn't
2019-02-23 09:19:04	+nance	guys should i eat weed today?
2019-02-23 09:19:05	zzzeyez	if you're on windows10 then there is already a unix subsystem anyways
2019-02-23 09:19:12	+shaan	wsl suckkkksss hard though
2019-02-23 09:19:12	zzzeyez	yes totally eat weeds
2019-02-23 09:19:14	+nance	yeah you can install bash
2019-02-23 09:19:14	+shaan	its so slow
2019-02-23 09:19:29	+nance	it's gay i got a new laptop and i had thrown ubuntu on it
2019-02-23 09:19:38	+nance	and i went on this date with this guy i'd been seeing for a couple of months
2019-02-23 09:19:41	+nance	we drank a lot and i passed out
2019-02-23 09:19:52	+nance	and he reimaged my laptop witn windows 10 to show me the windows linux subsystem
2019-02-23 09:19:55	+nance	i never talked to him again
2019-02-23 09:19:57	zzzeyez	wtf
2019-02-23 09:20:02	+nance	he worked at microsoft and was trying to convert me lol
2019-02-23 09:20:05	+nance	i blame the alcohol
2019-02-23 09:20:08	+nance	otherwise he was a really nice guy
2019-02-23 09:20:13	+nance	but i was like woah that's creepy bro
2019-02-23 09:20:13	zzzeyez	i personally like win10 but
2019-02-23 09:20:28	+nance	zzzeyez: it's fine. but i chose a mac for my new laptop at work
2019-02-23 09:20:31	+shaan	i dont like spyware 
2019-02-23 09:20:46	+nance	last windows i used personally was xp sp2
2019-02-23 09:21:06	+nance	some of the shit i have to support at work is windows and i dunno it's just so slow
2019-02-23 09:21:12	+nance	not sure if it's the budget hardware in the machines or what
2019-02-23 09:21:21	+shaan	i have windows installed on my work laptop but i also have manjaro on it so i only use windows when i need my bosses weird excel shit
2019-02-23 09:21:24	+nance	but tbh i could never afford a macbook and i wouldn't have one if i wasn't given one
2019-02-23 09:21:38	+nance	we do all of our weird excel shit on google sheets
2019-02-23 09:21:40	zzzeyez	one time: ok.. so i dated a girl with an eating disorder.  we were having problems with someone breaking into our apartment so i installed security cam software on my laptop.  she dropped me off to go skate and then i come home and she's like reformatting my laptop.  she got embarassed that the camera caught her binge eating and she was deleting everything
2019-02-23 09:21:40	+nance	i hate excel
2019-02-23 09:21:43	s1zZLe	shaan, one of the main reasons i haven't bothered getting into linux is because of the amount of gaming i do
2019-02-23 09:21:50	s1zZLe	SOOO many games have issues running properly on linux
2019-02-23 09:21:50	+shaan	i kinda miss having a macbook but i fucking love my x220
2019-02-23 09:21:56	+shaan	best laptop ive used 
2019-02-23 09:22:03	+shaan	s1zZLe: makes sense, i only console game
2019-02-23 09:22:04	zzzeyez	s1zZLe: don't bother with linux if yr a gamer
2019-02-23 09:22:11	+nance	what's the manufacturer? sorry i'm not big on hadware stuff shaan
2019-02-23 09:22:22	+nance	most of my laptops have been out of warranty hand me downs i've gotten from work over the years
2019-02-23 09:22:25	s1zZLe	yeah i have like 400 games in my steam library so, windows it is
2019-02-23 09:22:28	s1zZLe	at least on my gaming pc
2019-02-23 09:22:36	+shaan	nance: lenovo x220
2019-02-23 09:22:38	+nance	i had an old dell with an ssd that was a good workhorse
2019-02-23 09:22:40	s1zZLe	i want to buy another pc to install linux on and start properly learning shit
2019-02-23 09:22:41	+shaan	its old but its fucking awesome
2019-02-23 09:22:46	+shaan	especially running linux
2019-02-23 09:22:48	+nance	i had ubuntu on it and it was great
2019-02-23 09:22:55	+nance	but i got drunk and threw it one night
2019-02-23 09:23:01	+nance	so it brokethe hinges heh
2019-02-23 09:23:10	+nance	otherwise it would probably still be fine. it wasn't a pretty machine but it was very functional
2019-02-23 09:23:24	+nance	shaan: ah yeah if i was gonna get a pc i'd go lenovo i think
2019-02-23 09:23:24	+shaan	this thing is a fuckin tank, magnesium shell, amazing keyboard
2019-02-23 09:23:33	zzzeyez	maybe today that's what i'll do, install a linux partition on my laptop
2019-02-23 09:23:36	zzzeyez	lenovo is great
2019-02-23 09:23:46	+nance	i had one of those dell xps that flips into the tablet mode but it got fucked up when i had my bike accident
2019-02-23 09:23:57	+shaan	nance: i just dont like that they changed the keyboard after this model :((

2019-02-23 09:24:24	zzzeyez	new keyboards suck, old ones were amazing
2019-02-23 09:24:25	+nance	when i'm at work and using a mouse my shoulder gets reallly sore
2019-02-23 09:24:35	+nance	like my rotater cuff or something

2019-02-23 09:33:04	+nance	sure

2019-03-23 13:20:56	zzzeyez	i think i prefer light mode
2019-03-23 13:40:00	@foxnesn	but i thought dark mode was all the hotness?
2019-03-23 13:41:43	zzzeyez	i am convinced that it's honestly worse for your eyes
2019-03-23 13:41:57	zzzeyez	the only perk is that it uses less battery power on OLED screens where the blacks use 0 power

2019-03-24 11:55:00	+Elfeckin	my laptop is onlu usb3 no usb c=(
2019-03-24 11:55:09	zzzeyez	it's pretty mindblowing, especially thunderbolt 3 or w/e, i get 500mbps on my external drive..  and the bottleneck isn't even the cable
2019-03-24 11:55:09	+Elfeckin	so i cant tell how fast transfers are 
2019-03-24 11:55:16	+Elfeckin	wow
2019-03-24 11:55:18	+Elfeckin	thats silly
2019-03-24 11:55:20	zzzeyez	it's capable of 2gbps
2019-03-24 11:55:22	+Elfeckin	im happy with 100

2019-03-24 11:56:40	zzzeyez	800mbps is firewire
2019-03-24 11:56:42	+Elfeckin	stayed from 50-100 usualy arund 80 constabt
2019-03-24 11:57:20	zzzeyez	usb3 is 2gbps
2019-03-24 11:58:15	zzzeyez	but i think it's more complicated than the numbers show, regardless i am so in love with usb-c
2019-03-24 11:58:23	+Elfeckin	of course
2019-03-24 11:58:26	+Elfeckin	that not real world output
2019-03-24 11:58:49	+Elfeckin	thast all theoretical when they do tests with a brand new os from a new drive new cable and nothing running

2019-03-30 09:12:38	Elfeckin	blarg
2019-03-30 09:14:29	+Elfeckin_	why windows dumb
2019-03-30 09:14:51	+Elfeckin_	why is it that whne you tanfer a file ater you startyed a file transfer it doesnt quee it behind the one you firt started
2019-03-30 09:14:58	+Elfeckin_	why does it try to transfer at the same time
2019-03-30 09:15:23	+Elfeckin_	hmmm whats that one i used to use
2019-03-30 09:20:23	zzzeyez	i would think that would be more beneficial, to transfer multiple at once
2019-03-30 09:22:12	+Elfeckin_	but it doesnt
2019-03-30 09:22:19	+Elfeckin_	it slows down the first file that was transfering
2019-03-30 09:55:49	zzzeyez	but imagine a scenario where you are transferring a 10gb file, should you have to wait for that to finish before you can transfer a picture into your pictures folder?
2019-03-30 09:56:12	zzzeyez	the option should be available to do either, but the default should be that you can do multiple at once
2019-03-30 09:56:44	Elfeckin	that's different.  it should be smart.  small files can take priority over big file 
2019-03-30 09:56:56	Elfeckin	I see what your saying though. 
2019-03-30 09:58:54	zzzeyez	i'd agree with that, if the file is less than 30% the size of the previous file than it should start immediately, or something like that
2019-03-30 09:59:38	zzzeyez	maybe like: files larger than 100mb should queue, otherwise don't
2019-03-30 09:59:58	zzzeyez	so many people seem so cruel lately
2019-03-30 10:06:15	+Elfeckin_	yeah lots of extra hate

2019-03-30 11:12:10	zzzeyez	lucid dreaming is getting frustrating
2019-03-30 11:12:39	zzzeyez	like sometimes i just want to dream and not actively participate, the other night i actually woke myself up from my dream because i didn't want to participate
2019-03-30 11:13:32	Elfeckin	I wish I had that ability.  but from what I'm hearing from you I'd learn to hate it 
2019-03-30 11:48:08	zzzeyez	it's mostly really cool
2019-03-30 11:48:36	zzzeyez	just do reality checks, like for example look at your hand whenever you suspect that you are dreaming

2019-03-30 16:33:46	@prence	or a paper towel roll
2019-03-30 16:34:15	@prence	did you mean using a comma inside the quotation marks? cause you used it correctly there
2019-03-30 16:34:25	newroses_	that is my example
2019-03-30 16:34:25	newroses_	ok
2019-03-30 16:34:27	newroses_	i see ty
2019-03-30 16:34:47	newroses_	in which case would i use it outside?  if it was a complete sentence?
2019-03-30 16:35:06	@prence	parenthesis is when you'd use it outside
2019-03-30 16:35:28	wellshit	put one inside and outside to cover your bases
2019-03-30 16:35:38	philsabot	british put it outside the quotes, but its all context
2019-03-30 16:35:41	@prence	usually both outside
2019-03-30 16:35:55	@prence	philsabot, that's true too
2019-03-30 16:36:53	@prence	if you're using a turn of phrase, you'd use ' and ' with the comma outside
2019-03-30 16:37:16	@prence	but a quote is pretty much always inside, at least in the us
2019-03-30 16:38:07	newroses_	wait i thought with parantheses you always use it inside (like if it were like this,) is that not true?
2019-03-30 16:38:45	@prence	nah
2019-03-30 16:39:56	@prence	but you also don't usually need a comma in a situation like that
2019-03-30 16:40:01	@prence	so it looks kinda weird when it does happen
2019-03-30 16:40:29	newroses_	period would be the better example
2019-03-30 16:40:35	@prence	a parenthesis is like it's very own comma
2019-03-30 16:40:41	newroses_	it seems yr correct re: parantesis
2019-03-30 16:40:41	@prence	yeah so a period would be on the outside there

2019-03-30 18:28:51	@foxnesn	trolls and goblins only have range of 1 so if attacked by mage or archer they have to move before they can attack

2019-03-30 18:29:12	@foxnesn	so while archer and mage may not do as much damage they do get an extra hit or two in before counter attacked

2019-03-30 19:23:01	+shaan	nerd
2019-03-30 19:23:06	newroses_	so i have to create my own iso

2019-03-30 19:23:54	newroses_	and i like pacman / yaourt
2019-03-30 19:23:57	newroses_	not apt-get
2019-03-30 19:24:16	newroses_	it's easier in my case to build my own arch iso
2019-03-30 19:24:31	newroses_	possibly kde, probably i3 though
2019-03-30 19:25:06	+shaan	nobody uses apt-get anymore wtf\

2019-04-05 20:23:52	zzzeyez1	ehh apple music still kind of sucks
2019-04-05 20:24:03		You are now known as zzzeyez
2019-04-05 20:24:16	zzzeyez	never tried spotify before but i think i'm just going back to tidal
2019-04-05 20:24:40	zzzeyez	tidal and spotify seem to be the only ones that reliably scrobble
2019-04-05 20:24:51	+s1zZLe	spotify is okay
2019-04-05 20:24:54	+s1zZLe	i prefer google play music
2019-04-05 20:25:01	+s1zZLe	because fuck scrobbling
2019-04-05 20:25:36	+s1zZLe	scrobbling is like purposely listening to shit so people can see what you listen to and think you're cool
2019-04-05 20:25:46	+s1zZLe	i mean, that's why i used to it
2019-04-05 20:26:49	zzzeyez	well i mean i have scripts that i can't use anymore that are based off of last.fm, plus i have scrobbled since 2004 and i really like looking at how my tastes have changed over the years
2019-04-05 20:27:12	zzzeyez	i have used google play the last year but i am starting to really miss all the perks last.fm offered me
2019-04-05 20:27:35	+s1zZLe	to be honest, you have a point
2019-04-05 20:27:44	+s1zZLe	i have forgotten SO many bands that i used to love
2019-04-05 20:28:03	zzzeyez	and i'm learning that apple music is locked at 128kbps on cellular connection
2019-04-05 20:28:37	zzzeyez	i had tidal in 2017 and loved it, 320kbps, built-in scrobbling
2019-04-05 20:28:55	zzzeyez	but i do love that google play allows you to upload your own library
2019-04-05 20:29:14	zzzeyez	fuck it i'm cancelling my apple music account and going back to tidal right now
2019-04-05 20:29:24	+s1zZLe	Elfeckin, btw im dumb.. the riddle vs dream match was NOT on the pre-show

2019-04-05 20:43:35	+s1zZLe	doing those silly top-rope to the outside jump axhandle
2019-04-05 20:43:40	+s1zZLe	such a pointless move
2019-04-05 20:43:42	+s1zZLe	not impressive
2019-04-05 20:43:45	+s1zZLe	just does damage to your legs
2019-04-05 20:44:02	Elfeckin	young and black. his legs are springs 
2019-04-05 20:44:23	Elfeckin	but they will turn to dust in no timd6
2019-04-05 20:44:59	+s1zZLe	all it takes is one wrong twisted upon landing
2019-04-05 20:45:06	+s1zZLe	and goodbye tibia and fibula
2019-04-05 20:45:36	Elfeckin	rare injury though 
2019-04-05 20:45:58	+s1zZLe	because most people don't do a jumping axehandle from the top-rope to the outside...
2019-04-05 20:46:07	Elfeckin	can only think of Sid breaking his leg and his was because well 7 footers aren't supposed to climb ropes
2019-04-05 20:58:47	+s1zZLe	Velveteen is by no means a small man
2019-04-05 20:59:08	+s1zZLe	the fuck he's only 6'2" ?
2019-04-05 20:59:11	+s1zZLe	he looks huge in nxt
2019-04-05 20:59:17	+s1zZLe	i thought he was llike 6'8"

2019-04-08 22:48:16	+s1zZLe	7 years ago I had been alone for 3 years, had one friend in the world, was hopelessly addicted to smoking weed, and spent all my free time sitting at home alone at the computer.
2019-04-08 22:49:00	+s1zZLe	6 years ago, I joined community theatre for the first time and got to be in the ensemble/chorus for Les Miserables which is/was my favourite play.
2019-04-08 22:49:10	+s1zZLe	But still sat around alone in my free time..
2019-04-08 22:49:41	+s1zZLe	over the last 6 years, I've been lucky enough to do 5 more shows, and now im in the 6th, and just got cast for my 7th show in 6 years.

2019-04-25 20:45:22	ovns1	You like to make returns to REI?
2019-04-25 20:46:30	+myr	they've been talking about doing rentals
2019-04-25 20:46:46	zzzeyez	i returned my backpack for a new one after nearly a year today
2019-04-25 20:47:03	+myr	there's some things that I'd go for it cause I don't use them often enough to want to buy it and have it crammed in a closet forever
2019-04-25 20:48:55	ovns1	Eastpak backpacks had a lifetime guarentee back in the day and we actually returned them to get fixed when zippers broke.
2019-04-25 20:54:50	+myr	ll bean did too
2019-04-25 20:55:06	+myr	theirs didn't end until pretty recently
2019-04-25 20:56:01	ovns1	Looks like Eastpak still does it for 30 years.

When immigrants (particularly of the illegal persuasion coming from our neighbors down south) hear that we are "land of the

2019-05-08 13:30:04	+s1zZle	lol part of my point stems from the fact that I know full well that i have said some ridiculous shit in here just for the sake of argument in the heat of a moment within the past 15 years.  It doesn't mean that's exactly how i see the world at all times.  But the fact that people take those quote and assume he's walking around hating black people right now and shit is just stupid

2019-05-08 13:33:42	+s1zZle	Again, I'm not saying he wasn't in the wrong.  I just think it's more wrong to be ousted the way he is.
2019-05-08 13:34:19	+s1zZle	The fact that Big E basically squashed it shows me that it's already been discussed internally at WWE
2019-05-08 13:34:21	+s1zZle	so its no one elses business
2019-05-08 13:34:26	+s1zZle	if it bugs you that much, don't cheer for the guy
2019-05-08 13:34:35	+s1zZle	but people are ridiculous about this shit
2019-05-08 13:34:51	+s1zZle	trying to ruin someone's career/life is worse than saying racist shit on the internet
2019-05-08 13:35:03	+s1zZle	but because he's white and said some racist shit, people seem to treat him like he should die

2019-05-09 18:46:16	@prence	also they're calling EVERYTHING this game
2019-05-09 18:46:47	ovns	It was right near the ankle - I would have definitely broken something important if I didn't have them on.
2019-05-09 18:47:05	ovns	If they call everything both ways, I'm fine with it.
2019-05-09 18:47:28	ovns	Ovechkin has the loosest skates I've ever seen.
2019-05-09 18:47:35	@prence	same, altho it'll make it a bit more boring
2019-05-09 18:47:59	@prence	also I can't think of many pro d-men that wear fenders/guards
2019-05-09 18:48:03	@prence	I sure as fuck would
2019-05-09 18:49:31	ovns	A lot of them wear fenders, but they're way more form fitting/customized than my bulky ones.
2019-05-09 18:50:00	@prence	oh, I can't even tell then
2019-05-09 18:57:12	ovns	That was just a wrist shot from Ahem he blocked.  I think maybe they're giving him a graceful out for the rest of the playoffs.
2019-05-09 18:59:28	@prence	yeah it must have hit somewhere weird or somewhere already hurt
2019-05-09 18:59:44	@prence	he's been pretty slow the last few weeks but just figured that's because he's 109 years old

2019-05-11 10:35:55	+s1zZLe	Elfeckin_, , Jose Gonzalez too.  I can't believe WWF/WWE has celebrated him and mentioned him so many times on commentary
2019-05-11 10:36:28	+s1zZLe	Elfeckin_, how do you feel about Lars now that he made a public apology and has apparently spoken with members of New Day about the situation and apologized to them?
2019-05-11 10:37:25	+Elfeckin	i dont care
2019-05-11 10:37:28	+Elfeckin	too little to late

2019-05-11 10:40:30	+Elfeckin	absoutly 100 %
2019-05-11 10:40:37	+s1zZLe	so judgmental

2019-05-11 10:41:30	+s1zZLe	you're hating him based on hypotheticals
2019-05-11 10:41:49	+Elfeckin	hypotheiclasc? he bahsed on multiple diff sets of peopel not 1 man

2019-05-11 10:42:06	+s1zZLe	for me personally, I've changed my mindset just within the last year regarding one group of people
2019-05-11 10:42:09	+Elfeckin	hes not just aracist hes a bioot and a homophobe and a fucking mysonigyst
2019-05-11 10:42:11	+Elfeckin	hes all of the bad

2019-05-11 10:43:16	+s1zZLe	i dunno,, i think if his co-workers that are minorities are okay working with him and have been able to look past it, there's no reason for people like you to be so firmly against him or the possibility that he has changed/is changing.
2019-05-11 10:43:40	+s1zZLe	You're being intolerant of other people with different views, and that's the definition of bigotry, FYI
2019-05-11 10:44:04	+s1zZLe	just because you're being bigoted against something that is overwhelmingly considered to be wrong, doesn't mean you're in the right.
2019-05-11 10:44:06	+s1zZLe	just saying :)
2019-05-11 10:44:43		prence` is now known as prence

2019-05-11 10:46:39	+s1zZLe	if have said shit in here that was equally as bigoted and misguided as shit Lars said in the bodybuilding forums, but about different groups of people
2019-05-11 10:46:40	nayt	a bigot
2019-05-11 10:46:48	+s1zZLe	lol

2019-05-11 10:47:07	+s1zZLe	don't care so much what other people do and think, just focused on trying to be happy and living my life without upsetting people
2019-05-11 10:47:21	nayt	everyone gets upset over everything 
2019-05-11 10:48:01	@prence	wait like THE bodybuilding forums?
2019-05-11 10:48:08	+s1zZLe	*shrug*
2019-05-11 10:48:10	@prence	cause that place was straight up racism and shittiness combined
2019-05-11 10:48:17	+s1zZLe	exactly
2019-05-11 10:48:21	nayt	isn't that place all about monkey jokes
2019-05-11 10:48:22	+s1zZLe	a lot of people posted horrible shit in there
2019-05-11 10:48:25	@prence	nayt: yea

2019-05-11 10:49:05	+s1zZLe	now, Lars Sullivan, who was signed by WWE used to be a member of those boards.  Now that he's getting a push in WWE, people have dug up every hateful and bigoted thing he said and are trying to make him lose his job
2019-05-11 10:49:34	+s1zZLe	one person went so far as to email corporations that sponsor WWE, threatening to boycott their products if they continue to endorse WWE until WWE fires him
2019-05-11 10:49:40	@prence	oh yeah i forgot about the no takesies backsies law where you're not accountable for shit you did
2019-05-11 10:49:45	+s1zZLe	dude has apologized publicly, admitted he was wrong and had a messed up perspective
2019-05-11 10:49:46	nayt	haha

2019-05-11 10:50:08	nayt	YOU'RE NOW A LAWNMOWER 
2019-05-11 10:50:09	@prence	lol
2019-05-11 10:50:16	+s1zZLe	if his co-workers can forgive and move past it, not sure why people are freaking out and trying to get him fired
2019-05-11 10:50:18	@prence	STRONGEST LAWNMOWER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA
2019-05-11 10:50:23	+s1zZLe	oh also, most of the shit he said was like 10 years ago
2019-05-11 10:50:27	+s1zZLe	the most recent is 6 years ago
2019-05-11 10:50:42	nayt	well whatever. don't care about the timeline just want to know if dude still sees shit that way 
2019-05-11 10:50:51	nayt	and if he does, is he vocal about it
2019-05-11 10:50:52	+s1zZLe	he has stated that he doesn't
2019-05-11 10:50:56	+s1zZLe	no
2019-05-11 10:50:57	wellshit	can't a guy pile drive other guys and bury his face in their crotches in peace
2019-05-11 10:51:02	nayt	for real
2019-05-11 10:51:02	+s1zZLe	he said "those statements do not reflect who I am today"
2019-05-11 10:51:21	nayt	wasn't booker T the most racially driven wrestler ever
2019-05-11 10:51:41	+s1zZLe	"“There is no excuse for the inappropriate remarks that I made years ago. They do not reflect my personal beliefs nor who I am today, and I apologize to anyone I offended.”"
2019-05-11 10:51:49	+s1zZLe	People are saying it's a cannned apology and he doesn't mean it
2019-05-11 10:51:52	nayt	haha
2019-05-11 10:51:54	nayt	fuck those people
2019-05-11 10:52:01	+s1zZLe	meanwhile, he's done segments in TV with numerous people of minorities and shit
2019-05-11 10:52:01	nayt	OH OK SO HE APOLOGIZED 
2019-05-11 10:52:13	+s1zZLe	i mean, what more do people want?
2019-05-11 10:52:17	nayt	well
2019-05-11 10:52:24	nayt	that last part i dunno if that means anything haha
2019-05-11 10:52:27	@prence	wait so he's gotten paid to show up with minorities?
2019-05-11 10:52:35	nayt	haha that line is weird
2019-05-11 10:52:36	@prence	and that's like .. black points for him?
2019-05-11 10:52:36	+s1zZLe	uhh no
2019-05-11 10:52:37	@prence	lol
2019-05-11 10:52:42	nayt	HE HAS BLACK FRIENDS
2019-05-11 10:52:49	+s1zZLe	omg you're a moron sometimes
2019-05-11 10:52:50	@prence	I KNOW A COLORED FELLA
2019-05-11 10:53:00	nayt	MY SISTER'S EX BOYFRIEND'S DAUGHTER IS IXED
2019-05-11 10:53:01	nayt	MIXED
2019-05-11 10:53:07	+s1zZLe	both of you
2019-05-11 10:53:29	@prence	you seriously just said meanwhile he's done segments on tv with minorities 
2019-05-11 10:53:36	@prence	that's the entertainment version of "i know a black guy"
2019-05-11 10:53:48	nayt	true
2019-05-11 10:53:53	+s1zZLe	point being, if people really thought he hated black people, they probably wouldn't book him with black people
2019-05-11 10:54:04	+s1zZLe	my stance on this has been that it's obviously been discussed and handled internally within WWE
2019-05-11 10:54:08	nayt	they would tho
2019-05-11 10:54:09	nayt	for sure
2019-05-11 10:54:10	@prence	it's wrestling, of course they would lol
2019-05-11 10:54:17	nayt	it's PR
2019-05-11 10:54:21	@prence	yeah
2019-05-11 10:54:23	wellshit	yeah i think the only consideration is 'will this make us money' and if it doesn't then they won't do it
2019-05-11 10:54:23	+s1zZLe	ughhh
2019-05-11 10:54:24	@prence	live and die by that shit
2019-05-11 10:54:30	+s1zZLe	okay you're right, he's still racist and should be banned from having a career
2019-05-11 10:54:37	nayt	that's not what we're saying
2019-05-11 10:54:43	@prence	never said that, just said your excuse isn't a thing
2019-05-11 10:54:48	+s1zZLe	all i'm saying is that give a guy the benefit of the doub
2019-05-11 10:54:50	+s1zZLe	t
2019-05-11 10:54:55	+s1zZLe	he was 19 to 24 when he posted hateful shit in the forums
2019-05-11 10:54:56	+s1zZLe	now he's 30
2019-05-11 10:54:59	+s1zZLe	and a successful wrestler
2019-05-11 10:55:03	nayt	again
2019-05-11 10:55:04	+s1zZLe	i have no doubt his perspective has changed over time
2019-05-11 10:55:04	nayt	that last part
2019-05-11 10:55:15	@prence	right
2019-05-11 10:55:16	+s1zZLe	if your perspective is the same as it was 6 years ago, I fear for how little you learn and grow
2019-05-11 10:55:29	nayt	unless you're right all the time
2019-05-11 10:55:31	nayt	like me
2019-05-11 10:55:40	nayt	and just a massive success 
2019-05-11 10:55:44	nayt	with perfect everything
2019-05-11 10:55:50	+s1zZLe	he doesn't have perfect everything
2019-05-11 10:55:52	@prence	if he was still unloading boxes at fedex and weightlifting, while not being a successful wrestler, you think he'd learn and grow?
2019-05-11 10:56:05	nayt	he would need to become a successful wrestler first
2019-05-11 10:56:11	+s1zZLe	he was about to debut a few months ago and get pushed to have a match with John Cena at Wrestlemania.. meaning they had big things planned for him... but he had anxiety problems and had to go home
2019-05-11 10:56:18	+s1zZLe	so he's obviously a person, with flaws, like any of us
2019-05-11 10:56:24	+s1zZLe	we all say and do fucked up things sometimes
2019-05-11 10:56:26	+s1zZLe	they're called mistakes
2019-05-11 10:56:37	nayt	nobody is arguing that
2019-05-11 10:56:47	+s1zZLe	prence, if he was still stuck in one of those jobs, perhaps he wouldn't have gained the life experience that enabled him to learn and grow
2019-05-11 10:57:05	+s1zZLe	the wrestling industry is very diverse now, so he would have HAD TO learn and grow in order to fnd success there
2019-05-11 10:57:08	@prence	so being richer than the black people he insulted is the solution to racism
2019-05-11 10:57:09	@prence	gotcha
2019-05-11 10:57:14	+s1zZLe	if people caught on that he was a bigot years ago, he would have been buried and never allowed to succeed
2019-05-11 10:57:19	+s1zZLe	wtf
2019-05-11 10:57:20	+s1zZLe	wow dude
2019-05-11 10:57:26	nayt	here's the thing 
2019-05-11 10:57:30	@prence	nah he would have and should have been fired from his fedex job
2019-05-11 10:57:31	nayt	wrestling is mainly all white dudes 
2019-05-11 10:57:37	nayt	and appeal to a lot of rural folk
2019-05-11 10:57:48	+s1zZLe	lol
2019-05-11 10:57:53	+s1zZLe	so people who say racist shit online don't deserve jobs?
2019-05-11 10:58:02	nayt	no i'm saying it's the name of the game
2019-05-11 10:58:13	+s1zZLe	no i'm talking to prence
2019-05-11 10:58:27	+s1zZLe	I hate how knee-jerk everyone is about this shit
2019-05-11 10:58:33	nayt	remember when you skyped me and kept screaming the N word 
2019-05-11 10:58:36	+s1zZLe	someone says something they hate, and it's like the immediate resopnse is hate and anger
2019-05-11 10:58:42	+s1zZLe	then we all wonder why there's so much hate and anger in the world
2019-05-11 10:58:50	@prence	uh, yeah, it's called hate speech for ya reason
2019-05-11 10:58:54	@prence	ya damn syrup swallower
2019-05-11 10:58:55	Elfeckin_	he stopped posting hateful shit only once he was signed. 
2019-05-11 10:59:00	@prence	^
2019-05-11 10:59:05	@prence	shocker.
2019-05-11 10:59:07	+s1zZLe	omg i'm over this
2019-05-11 10:59:09	+s1zZLe	you guys are being so fucking ignorant
2019-05-11 10:59:18	wellshit	why do you care about the hate and anger in the world when it affects something you're interested in?
2019-05-11 10:59:18	+s1zZLe	someone guilty of hate speech still deserves a chance at redemption
2019-05-11 10:59:24	@prence	he stopped being outwardly racist once he had a career to worry about
2019-05-11 10:59:26	Elfeckin_	I think it's more cuz what my mom taught me about my religion and how we were persecuted as a people 
2019-05-11 10:59:36	Elfeckin_	might bother me on. deeper level
2019-05-11 10:59:48	wellshit	i mean part of this is a reaction to years of abuse by people towards black people, but now we should all hold hands because a wrestler is getting called out for some shit he did?
2019-05-11 10:59:56	+s1zZLe	well, I was taught that humans are fucked up and flawed, we say and think stupid shit when we're young that we often grow up and regret when we reflect
2019-05-11 10:59:57	@prence	lol
2019-05-11 11:00:25	+s1zZLe	wellshit, no i'm not saying he shouldn't have to apologize or explain himself.. I'm just saying it's a bit far to try and ruin someones career over shit they said SIX TO TEN YEARS AGO
2019-05-11 11:00:38	+s1zZLe	we have no way of knowing that he hasn't changed, and to assume so is just ignorant.
2019-05-11 11:00:41	wellshit	issuing an apology is not enough and does not reflect anything other than an attempt to mitigate damage to his brand, and the brand of the company that employs him
2019-05-11 11:00:52	nayt	if the WWE isn't a save haven for throwing around pejoratives, i don't know what is 
2019-05-11 11:01:02	wellshit	he's an adult, he can do more
2019-05-11 11:01:03	wellshit	and should
2019-05-11 11:01:05	@prence	right, this just happens to be the one thing you're bringing up because it's wrestling related, so you're invested
2019-05-11 11:01:16	@prence	i forgot about the time you defended justin bieber for saying nigger in a video
2019-05-11 11:01:22	nayt	wow
2019-05-11 11:01:29	wellshit	PRENCE IS GETTING FIRED
2019-05-11 11:01:44	+s1zZLe	also, i have no idea wtf you guys are talking about
2019-05-11 11:01:51	@prence	s1zZLe is logan paul's lawyer
2019-05-11 11:02:03	nayt	remember when you PMed me and said you hate whoopi goldberg's lips 
2019-05-11 11:02:11	@prence	haaa
2019-05-11 11:02:28	wellshit	i'm saying that who gives a shit if some used-to-be racist wrestler apologized
2019-05-11 11:02:37	+s1zZLe	i hate that you guys are literally incapable of real conversation without devolving into nonsense
2019-05-11 11:02:39	+s1zZLe	like ever
2019-05-11 11:02:45	wellshit	if he's going to own that he changed then he should demonstrate that beyond some stupid words on a piece of paper
2019-05-11 11:02:54	nayt	wellshit
2019-05-11 11:02:58	nayt	didn't you read, bro
2019-05-11 11:03:03	nayt	he did some TV spots with blacks
2019-05-11 11:03:08	+s1zZLe	wellshit, that's my point
2019-05-11 11:03:13	@prence	you keep parroting the same point about change without anything different, we get bored and nate starts talking about whoopi goldberg
2019-05-11 11:03:13	+s1zZLe	but there are droves of idiots on reddit trying to get him fired
2019-05-11 11:03:14	wellshit	and getting paid to work with black people is not the same goddamn thing
2019-05-11 11:03:24	wellshit	well yeah because he hasn't done anything else
2019-05-11 11:03:28	+s1zZLe	my point is simply that trying to get a guy fired without giving him a chance to explain or redeem himself is worse than writing hateful shit on the internet
2019-05-11 11:03:29	@prence	PREACH
2019-05-11 11:03:30	wellshit	so fuck him
2019-05-11 11:03:52	wellshit	he can go back to doing whatever it is he was doing before
2019-05-11 11:03:58	wellshit	working at cabelas and lifting trucks in his free time
2019-05-11 11:03:59	nayt	getting swole 
2019-05-11 11:04:00	pyro	nayt just got back from gym
2019-05-11 11:04:02	pyro	u wanna throw down?
2019-05-11 11:04:04	@prence	he's had 6 years of chances to redeem himself and the only one you can point to is BEING PAID to work with black people
2019-05-11 11:04:27	+s1zZLe	lol what's a guy supposed to do?  Write a book about his repentance?
2019-05-11 11:04:28	pyro	who wants to work with blacks
2019-05-11 11:04:35	nayt	cabelas has some quality shit
2019-05-11 11:04:38	+s1zZLe	I'm just saying people are way overboard with this shit
2019-05-11 11:04:55	wellshit	well i apologized, what else do people want from me
2019-05-11 11:05:01	@prence	lol
2019-05-11 11:05:18	@prence	now that he's all rich and shit maybe he can start a charity that he never works with!
2019-05-11 11:05:21	wellshit	he could use what little fame he has to advocate for real social change
2019-05-11 11:05:25	+s1zZLe	I mean, an apology is step one... demonstrating change over time is the next
2019-05-11 11:05:28	+s1zZLe	people aren't allowing that
2019-05-11 11:05:48	@prence	you said yourself that there was time since the most recent racist comment
2019-05-11 11:05:52	wellshit	because the catalyst for the apology was people point out that he was doing these things in the past
2019-05-11 11:05:54	@prence	how did people not allow that over the last 6 yrs
2019-05-11 11:05:57	@prence	right
2019-05-11 11:06:03	wellshit	so if you do something shitty and i call you out for it and your only response to apologize it's not enough
2019-05-11 11:06:06	@prence	apology world tour 2019
2019-05-11 11:06:18	nayt	haha
2019-05-11 11:06:19	nayt	like
2019-05-11 11:06:25	nayt	atlanta to apologize to certain demographic
2019-05-11 11:06:28	wellshit	if no one had ever found it he wouldn't have said or done shit about it
2019-05-11 11:06:31	+s1zZLe	wellshit, of course.. but when a person apologizes and acknowledges wrong doing and claims they've changed, we should probably give them a chance to show that
2019-05-11 11:06:39	+s1zZLe	rather than be like "nope, fuck you.. we're gonna ruin your dreams instead"
2019-05-11 11:06:43	@prence	HES HAD SIX YEARS OF CHANCES
2019-05-11 11:06:46	@prence	for fucks sake
2019-05-11 11:06:49	+s1zZLe	omg you guys are driving me fucking crazy
2019-05-11 11:06:53	+s1zZLe	wtf could he have done?
2019-05-11 11:06:56	+s1zZLe	he's not a big rich wrestler
2019-05-11 11:06:57	wellshit	because he has had 6 years to do something instead of waiting for people to find it then point it out
2019-05-11 11:07:00	@prence	just because he was caught now?
2019-05-11 11:07:08	@prence	wtf donate some time or energy to a cause
2019-05-11 11:07:10	wellshit	IM SORRY I GOT CAUGHT is basically what's happening here
2019-05-11 11:07:13	@prence	yea
2019-05-11 11:07:24	+s1zZLe	i am willing to bet that he thought it would never come to light.. in which case, his best course of action would be to leave it in the past and just be a different person moving forward
2019-05-11 11:07:35	nayt	i'm sorry you're offended i groped that woman 
2019-05-11 11:07:39	@prence	and he's done that by .. not being racist more?
2019-05-11 11:07:42	+s1zZLe	or is he supposed to be like "DEAR GENERAL PUBLIC, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I USED TO BE A HATEFUL IDIOT, BUT I'VE CHANGED.  I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AND LOVE ME"
2019-05-11 11:07:55	+s1zZLe	we don't know
2019-05-11 11:08:02	+s1zZLe	maybe he's kind and gracious to all people now?
2019-05-11 11:08:15	+s1zZLe	if he wasn't, we'd hear reports about it from people within wwe and wrestling journalists
2019-05-11 11:08:18	nayt	i want that cabelas employee discount tho
2019-05-11 11:08:18	@prence	yeah because he signed with a huge wrestling corp and doesn't need to post about black people on message boards anymore
2019-05-11 11:08:21	+s1zZLe	instead, it's redditors digging shit up from a decade ago
2019-05-11 11:08:46	+s1zZLe	again, you're basing that on assuming that he hasn't grown or changed his mind since he was 19 to 24
2019-05-11 11:09:01	@prence	you're basing it on assuming he HAS
2019-05-11 11:09:02	nayt	but you're assuming he's not racist because it was x amount of years ago 
2019-05-11 11:09:04	+s1zZLe	at 30, I was a completely different person than I was at 24
2019-05-11 11:09:18	nayt	see
2019-05-11 11:09:22	nayt	you're doing the same thing
2019-05-11 11:09:32	+s1zZLe	no, i'm giving him the benefit of the doubt and a chance to change
2019-05-11 11:09:37	+s1zZLe	you guys are just unwilling to do so
2019-05-11 11:09:40	nayt	lol
2019-05-11 11:09:46	+s1zZLe	"someone said something racist once, fuck them forever"
2019-05-11 11:09:51	+s1zZLe	is basically all im seeing
2019-05-11 11:09:51	nayt	why should we think that someone who went out of his way to be racist is no longer racist 
2019-05-11 11:09:58	+s1zZLe	uggghhhhhh
2019-05-11 11:09:59	+s1zZLe	again
2019-05-11 11:10:05	nayt	CAUSE HE FLIES FROM THE TOP ROPES
2019-05-11 11:10:06	+s1zZLe	you said stupid shit at 24 that you wouldn't have said at 30
2019-05-11 11:10:14	+s1zZLe	but anyway
2019-05-11 11:10:17	+s1zZLe	i'm done with this conversation
2019-05-11 11:10:18	nayt	i don't think i did.
2019-05-11 11:10:28	@prence	lol you said that like 2 days ago when you argued about it with Elfeckin_ 
2019-05-11 11:10:31	Elfeckin_	I've got a snake man! https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/P7EzQvDy/20190511_130930.jpg
2019-05-11 11:10:32	nayt	i think i was a beacon of morality

2019-05-11 11:11:20	@prence	lol
2019-05-11 11:11:21	+s1zZLe	yet everyone else is still like "nope, once a racist always a racist.. end him"
2019-05-11 11:11:34	+s1zZLe	people who are not close to the situation are still reacting
2019-05-11 11:11:37	+s1zZLe	people within the situation are not
2019-05-11 11:11:38	nayt	leave it to someone from mississippiglaugla to defend the racist
2019-05-11 11:11:39	+s1zZLe	that tells me a lot
2019-05-11 11:11:51	+s1zZLe	omfg i hate you SO Much
2019-05-11 11:11:51	@prence	or they're like "prove it and stop apologizing to the towel washer like a weirdo"
2019-05-11 11:12:10	nayt	ahaha
2019-05-11 11:12:25	nayt	"you're important. you have worth. i am sorry for what i said about your people"
2019-05-11 11:12:29	@prence	hah
2019-05-11 11:13:02	nayt	like when trump had that taco bowl
2019-05-11 11:13:19	+s1zZLe	or possibly like "yeah i said some fucked up shit in the past.  I was raised by a racist family and didn't know any better.  But i've learned and grown a lot since then and I hope you can give me a chance to prove that moving forward"
2019-05-11 11:13:27	+s1zZLe	but noooo, people can't even consider that a convo like that might have taken place
2019-05-11 11:13:28	nayt	nah

2019-05-11 11:13:53	+s1zZLe	most people tend to follow what they're taught until they learn otherwise......

2019-05-11 11:14:12	@prence	cause that's weird
2019-05-11 11:14:18	nayt	he had the cognitive ability to learn right from wrong 
2019-05-11 11:14:24	+s1zZLe	legally yes, but in terms of perspective and life experience, no

2019-05-11 11:14:59	+s1zZLe	you're assuming he went around calling people N-bombs
2019-05-11 11:15:03	nayt	"my mom says it all the time"
2019-05-11 11:15:13	+s1zZLe	rather than stating things he thought were fact like "statistically, there are more poor black people than white people"
2019-05-11 11:15:18	@prence	yeah im sure that's the issue, I saw the shit pasted in here the other day

2019-05-11 11:17:59	+s1zZLe	uhh no, i'm saying he may have changed because he said he has, and i'm willing to give him a chance to prove it

2019-05-11 11:19:31	+s1zZLe	i'm just willing to give the benefit of the doubt
2019-05-11 11:19:35	+s1zZLe	based on the fact that he's still working for WWE
2019-05-11 11:19:36	nayt	you have his racism to confirm
2019-05-11 11:19:42	+s1zZLe	black wrestlers have tweeted about it like it's no big thing
2019-05-11 11:19:43	@prence	you also told us he works with black people so it's cool now
2019-05-11 11:20:01	@prence	wtf are black wrestlers going to say
2019-05-11 11:20:05	nayt	haha the WWE is not a barometer for racial equality 
2019-05-11 11:20:09	+s1zZLe	not just "he's worked with black people" but more "he's worked with black people who have a position in the company where they could have refused, based on everything we're talking about"
2019-05-11 11:20:17	+s1zZLe	the WWE Champion, Kofi Kingston
2019-05-11 11:20:27	+s1zZLe	Long time veteran and one-day hall-of-famer, R-Truth
2019-05-11 11:20:35	@prence	here, let me lose my job as an independent contractor for a giant corporation because I'm not cool with this fucking racist
2019-05-11 11:20:36	+s1zZLe	2 people even mentioned by name in his racist tweets
2019-05-11 11:20:41	+s1zZLe	he's been in segments with them both
2019-05-11 11:20:45	nayt	vince mcmahon is besties with donald j trump
2019-05-11 11:20:49	nayt	your argument is bullshit
2019-05-11 11:20:52	+s1zZLe	which tells me they discussed it internally, and squashed any issues there may have been
2019-05-11 11:20:56	@prence	oh for free? he did it for free? to help them out?
2019-05-11 11:21:08	@prence	to be a friend to people of other ethnicities?
2019-05-11 11:21:11	@prence	that was cool of him
2019-05-11 11:21:19	+s1zZLe	that is nto at all what i'm saying
2019-05-11 11:21:24	@prence	or was he paid tons of money by WWE to be in segments with black people
2019-05-11 11:21:27	@prence	cause that sounds like the thing.
2019-05-11 11:21:29	+s1zZLe	it's like you're purposely misunderstanding absolutely everything i try to say
2019-05-11 11:21:39	+s1zZLe	just to purposely take an opposing stance and trigger me
2019-05-11 11:21:41	+s1zZLe	suck dicks, boys
2019-05-11 11:21:54	@prence	it's like you're purposely ignoring any viewpoint that doesn't save your racist hero

2019-05-11 11:22:26	+s1zZLe	i just think it's INSANE how SO many people are taking one firm stance like it's an All or Nothing situations, with no grey area
2019-05-11 11:22:31	@prence	but you know the age range in which he made racist comments?
2019-05-11 11:22:34	+s1zZLe	zero chance for redemption or reptentance 
2019-05-11 11:22:39	@prence	kinda weird thing to know about someone you don't care about
2019-05-11 11:22:40	+s1zZLe	you're all just assuming he's still racist, based on nothing
2019-05-11 11:22:45	+s1zZLe	and your only argument is that i can't prove he's not racist
2019-05-11 11:22:51	+s1zZLe	it's fucking... leftist as FUCK
2019-05-11 11:23:08	nayt	haha well it's logic

2019-05-11 11:23:29	nayt	i don't empathize with racists
2019-05-11 11:23:32	@prence	zero empathy for the poor white racist
2019-05-11 11:23:35	@prence	:(((((((
2019-05-11 11:23:43	@prence	sorry, rich white racist
2019-05-11 11:23:45	+s1zZLe	empathy for ignorant people who regret their previous actions or mindsets
2019-05-11 11:23:57	+s1zZLe	because i was once a person with perspectives that i'm now ashamed of
2019-05-11 11:24:25	nayt	so you're a racist apologist because of your own insecurities 
2019-05-11 11:24:29	+s1zZLe	I'm basing my hope/belief that he's changed on my own experience in having grown and changed significantly in the last 10 years
2019-05-11 11:24:34	@prence	p r o j e c t i o n
2019-05-11 11:25:03	nayt	we're really getting to the root of the issue here 
2019-05-11 11:25:06	+s1zZLe	it's not projection, it's considering my own life experiences and things i've learned while trying to understand someone elses situation
2019-05-11 11:25:08	+s1zZLe	ie: EMPATHY
2019-05-11 11:25:22	@prence	nah you're describing sympathy lol
2019-05-11 11:25:28	nayt	no you said you want to believe he's a changed man because you too had shameful ideals and convictions, but are working on them
2019-05-11 11:26:02	nayt	my dick is rock hard

2019-05-11 11:26:31	+s1zZLe	lol  you're both making so little sense that I can only assume you're only engaged in this conversation to trigger me
2019-05-11 11:26:34	+s1zZLe	you clearly feel nothing about it
2019-05-11 11:26:42	+s1zZLe	other than laughing at s1zZLe for being triggered over it
2019-05-11 11:26:46	+s1zZLe	so really, fuck you both
2019-05-11 11:26:50	+s1zZLe	bigots
2019-05-11 11:26:57	+s1zZLe	you're both hateful bigots
2019-05-11 11:27:02	nayt	i don't care about the guy. but from everything you've said today, i know he's a racist and is probably still a racist. just a racist that doesn't want to lose a cushy job. 
2019-05-11 11:27:48	+s1zZLe	and that's based on YOUR experience of never feeling bad about anything you say or think
2019-05-11 11:27:54	+s1zZLe	or even reflecting on it for that matter

2019-05-11 16:32:14	zzzeyez	that girl was on a bunch of xanax, i really hope she doesn't even remember it
2019-05-11 16:32:44	Elfeckin_	well bunch of Xanax equals very conceivably not remember
2019-05-11 16:32:53	Elfeckin_	I've lost many a nights to xanax
2019-05-11 16:33:21	zzzeyez	i have only done it a few times (or clonazepam) but i don't remember any of it
2019-05-11 16:37:31	ovns	I think I slept so long last night that I had slight depersonalization today.
2019-05-11 16:39:29	zzzeyez	interesting
2019-05-11 16:40:10	zzzeyez	have you experienced a thing where you fall asleep drunk enough that your body gets deprived of REM and it begins to fight for REM sleep while you're awake and then you begin to confuse dreams and reality?
2019-05-11 16:40:20	zzzeyez	drunk often enough*
2019-05-11 16:41:55	ovns	I have definitely asked people about things that they'd only told me in dreams and had never really occurred.

2019-05-12 16:21:11	zzzeyez	they are called dots because they begin with a dot so that they are invisible (/home/zzzeyez/.config/*)
