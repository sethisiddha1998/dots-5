2018-02-24 04:26:14	hexnewbie	xnekomata: So unless you enable unconditional overcommit setting or swap, you'd have VMs refusing to start.

2018-02-24 04:26:48	hexnewbie	However, unconditional overcommit is risky, and swap on hypervisors doesn't work well, as Linux decides to swap out VMs where there is still plenty of memory available.

2018-02-24 04:27:34	hexnewbie	xnekomata: Not sure, I use libvirt with currentMemory of 1 GiB and memory of 4 GiB, but I believe maxMemory of 4 GiB has a similar effect.
2018-02-24 04:27:34	xnekomata	I mean, when I used qemu I just used to set the -M 2G

The only downside to having more swap space than you will actually use, is the disk space you will be reserving for it.

2018-02-24 14:50:51	jml2	usually the kernel backfalls to another clocksource if it determines an unreliable clocksource

2018-02-24 14:55:27	neoncortex	for those who understand security: there is a possbility of place code inside a image? more specifically, favicons? i wrote an application that are using favicons i get from https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=, and the icons seems to share someking of header, i mean, they all share the same byte pattern at beginning of the file ..
2018-02-24 14:55:39	jml2	elichai2, tsc is supposed to be better than hpet.. but tell me what kernel version are you using?
2018-02-24 14:55:52	jml2	elichai2, if you're using an old kernel, tsc is not stable with old kernels
