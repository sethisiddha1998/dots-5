2018-02-26 17:55:16	zzzeyez	hi, i'm uploading my first program to github via macOS using the web interface.  the program contains some bash scripts that are -rwxr-xr--, but after i upload and then git clone back to my laptop they become -rw-r--r-- so that i now get "Permission denied"
2018-02-26 17:55:51	matkatmusic	i'm trying to get xcode to pull the latest remote changes from my repo, and it never pulls down the proper added files that live on the remote branch.

Because the only changes are whitespace and formatting, I can always checkout --theirs, then run formatter, then add; This is my exec script: "git checkout --theirs .; javafmt . ;git add . ; git commit --amend --no-edit", but it fails when there are conflicts (based on rewriting of previous commits). How can I automate

2018-02-26 19:50:49	ealfonso	it's an eclipse java source code formatter run on the cli
2018-02-26 19:51:00	igemnace	you said it was already formatted properly
2018-02-26 19:51:28	ealfonso	origin/master => formatted properly. local-feature-branch => not formatted properly
2018-02-26 19:52:45	igemnace	a final formatting commit on your local feature branch before merging and pushing would be great there...

2018-03-18 08:11:43	+ringer1	I think I know why -- so yes to amend.  One of the intermediate changes was very small so I used -amend with a push before

2018-03-18 08:12:08	+ringer1	Presumably that left the remote in a "later commit" even though to me it wasn't
2018-03-18 08:12:13	_ikke_	then the message to pull is a bit misleading, and does indeed merging the old and new histories together
2018-03-18 08:12:23	_ikke_	ringer1: it was diverged
2018-03-18 08:12:55	+ringer1	I understand, other than fixing it -- what should/could I have done (obviously just a new commit instead of an amend)
2018-03-18 08:13:16	+ringer1	This isn't a big deal, mostly for *ME* to learn more about git
2018-03-18 08:13:37	_ikke_	If it's a private branch (no others are working on it), you can force push (git push --force-with-lease)
2018-03-18 08:14:01	+ringer1	Ok, that makes sense, and in this case would have been fine.

2018-03-18 11:04:29	rafasc	TheWild: if you google around, you'll find that people advise to symlink the other way around.. But I find that's bad advice.
2018-03-18 11:05:21	TheWild	well, I made a copy of the file anyway.
2018-03-18 11:05:22	rafasc	It's easy to forget you have that link, checkout another branch and now you have exposed a totally different file.
2018-03-18 11:06:17	TheWild	actually I forgot that it was a symlink, but "120000" told me something isn't quite right - the permission bits should be the same as other files.

2018-03-18 11:10:38	mchl_nix	Hey, I'm working with windows files on linux. So there is the line ending issue. Eclipse seems to just stick the line endings the file already has at the end of my changes. But I'm confused, because now in git diff the CRs are shown as white space errors (^M) but they are only in the new lines. Not the replaced ones.
2018-03-18 11:11:32	mchl_nix	Is it normal, that they only show up in the added lines? I checked the hex and the removed lines had CRLF as well. But then git diff also shows, that I changed an empty line with an appended CR. Really confused.

2018-03-18 19:06:56	+GitUserOnlyJust	I would like to get a list of files, present in the index after having been `git add`-ed, but which differ from the corresponding files in the working copy.  (In other words, files which have been edited after they were `git add`-ed.)   But `git diff-index` and `git diff-files` baffle me.
2018-03-18 19:07:07	+GitUserOnlyJust	For this base case, do I want:  `git diff-files --name-only --diff-filter=A`  ?
2018-03-18 19:07:19	+GitUserOnlyJust	I'm working on a pre-commit hook, to detect and warn me if there are files present in my working copy which have been edited/modified subsequent to them being `git add`-ed.  (One case: the file was `git-add`-ed, then edited, and I forgot to `git status` before performing a `git commit`.
