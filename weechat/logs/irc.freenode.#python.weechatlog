2018-04-01 14:44:19	greatgatsby	Hello.  I'm writing a Django app, but this is more of a Python question.  I have many classes, each of which represent a form.  All the forms are subclasses of various other types of forms.  Here's an example:  https://paste.pound-python.org/show/dSeAaY6PXSQ8PjeMVqZT/     The __init__ function is modified so that the form renders as a horizontal form.  In keeping with the DRY principle, I'd like to create a decorator so I can decorate ea
2018-04-01 14:44:19	greatgatsby	ch form with @horizontal or something like that.  I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to create a decorator for a class's __init__method.
