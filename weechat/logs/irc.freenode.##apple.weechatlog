2018-02-26 20:16:17	mwilson	I have all of mine, too, but that doesn't mean they need to be on the device.
2018-02-26 20:16:57	mwilson	zchrykng: Oh, there are fools every day who are about to lose their water because imessage might be out of order.
2018-02-26 20:17:44	zchrykng	Oh... I don't particularly care if it is out of order, I just want to make sure I have everything. Which I sometimes don't comparing my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro.
2018-02-26 20:18:47	mwilson	Why compare?  If the information is important, you save it.  Otherwise, who cares?  Obviously some people do.  Myself, I don't see why people have such a problem with saving what's important.
2018-02-26 20:19:52	zchrykng	It isn't so much that I am sitting down and comparing everything. It is more that I go looking for a conversation and can't find it, but switch devices and can.
2018-02-26 20:20:18	mwilson	If the conversation is important, why isn't it backed up?
2018-02-26 20:20:32	zchrykng	I make backups.

2018-02-26 20:28:00	zchrykng	You really can't use iMessage if the messages never show up on any of your devices.
2018-02-26 20:28:33	zchrykng	I'm not saying that should be the only place they exist.
2018-02-26 20:28:48	arahael	When my wife needed to keep a record of a conversation, she took screenshots and put them into dropbox.

2018-02-26 20:31:52	zchrykng	I think we are arguing about completely different use cases. I'm not talking about being able to go back and retreive old conversations, I want to be able to switch devices mid conversation and still have the complete context on the new devices. Or to be able to setup a new device have the previous conversations with various contacts. I make backup
2018-02-26 20:31:52	zchrykng	s, but in this case I think if you are having to restore from a backup, your system has already failed.
2018-02-26 20:31:54	mwilson	arahael: Isn't backing up SMS to Calendar still a thing on Android?  When I was an Android user, I had some app, I disremember the name, that would insert SMS's into a calendar you told it to use.  Then you could go to that day, and see all the messages.  Used to do the same thing with the call log.  I admit I haven't been an Android user for a few years, is that no longer a thing?
2018-02-26 20:32:09	jfcaron	How can I make OSX recognize my external USB numpad?  The keyboard identification wizard wants me to press buttons not present on the numpad.  Can I just set it to "generic keyboard" in Terminal or something?
2018-02-26 20:32:38	mwilson	zchrykng: Oh, you think Continuity and Handoff are good ideas, then.  I make sure to disable them on any device.
2018-02-26 20:32:58	zchrykng	jfcaron: Just press them on whatever full keyboard you have. It should work.
2018-02-26 20:33:22	jfcaron	On the MBP?
2018-02-26 20:33:25	jfcaron	Ok.
2018-02-26 20:33:30	mwilson	Sounds like a poor USB numberpad, if it's not correctly identifying itself.
2018-02-26 20:33:31	zchrykng	mwilson: Eh, I don't use hand off at all basically. If they worked seamlessly I might feel better about it.
2018-02-26 20:33:58	zchrykng	mwilson: Most external keyboards do this on macOS in my limited experience.
2018-02-26 20:34:31	jfcaron	Ah cool.  And whoever coded Caves of Qud makes proper use of how OSX interprets a numpad.
2018-02-26 20:34:41	jfcaron	I.e. numbers instead of arrow keys and such.
2018-02-26 20:34:48	mwilson	Yes, but this isn't a keyboard, it's a number pad.  OS X asks you to do things like press the shift key to the left of the Z and other silly things, number pads don't have shift keys.
2018-02-26 20:35:17	mwilson	arahael: So, no longer a thing, then?

2018-02-26 20:55:16	jrg	vs just opting for a legit SSD
2018-02-26 20:55:57	zchrykng	jrg: Probably nothing, since they would just pass the cost along to the customer. They probably make more sales though because of the lower entry price.
2018-02-26 20:56:06	zchrykng	cost + markup
2018-02-26 20:56:19	jrg	I guess. they don’t have anything for SSD other than the 256GB pcie nand
2018-02-26 20:56:58	zchrykng	jrg: Looking at the Mac Mini?
2018-02-26 20:57:05	jrg	just doesn’t make sense to use a fusion drive. for that they might as well just throw in a 32GB nand with zfs on it heh
2018-02-26 20:57:13	jrg	just looking at it to see if it’s worth it.
2018-02-26 20:57:15	jrg	it’s not
2018-02-26 20:57:29	jrg	too expensive for what it is.. although the size is nice
2018-02-26 20:57:45	zchrykng	jrg: Check out the Intel NUCs, are basically mac minis.

2018-02-26 20:58:55	zchrykng	From what I have read there is little fighting required, but I understand.
2018-02-26 20:58:59	jrg	so there is no normal mac nowadays huh? just the imac Mac Pro and Mac mini
2018-02-26 20:59:13	jrg	zchrykng: i hear that too. but updating a fake box is a pain from what i hear
2018-02-26 20:59:27	jrg	I’d rather not even deal with that headache
2018-02-26 20:59:35	zchrykng	The iMac and iMac Pro are the only things that are close to up to date.
2018-02-26 20:59:46	zchrykng	Don't burn money on the other ones.
2018-02-26 20:59:56	jrg	yeah. imac pro is interesting.. but that built in screen
2018-02-26 21:00:09	jrg	too bad there isn’t a mid level mac without the built in screen nowadays
2018-02-26 21:00:09	zchrykng	That is my position also.
2018-02-26 21:00:22	 *	jrg busts out the G5
2018-02-26 21:00:22	zchrykng	I am hoping a reasonable Mac Pro comes out this year.
2018-02-26 21:00:34	jrg	yeah. Mac Pro way too expensive
2018-02-26 21:00:39	zchrykng	I just want an updated cheese grater.
2018-02-26 21:00:46	jrg	surprised apple doesn’t have a typical mac
2018-02-26 21:00:54	jrg	zchrykng: i wish. they’d sell out on the first day
2018-02-26 21:01:07	jrg	no idea wtf they’re thinking with that cylinder design.. guess they wanted to be different bad
2018-02-26 21:01:16	zchrykng	They might learn something from that, not that I would count on it.
2018-02-26 21:01:19	jrg	G5 was the prettiest mac they ever made
2018-02-26 21:01:49	jrg	the Mac mini would be worth it if it were a bit more powerful
2018-02-26 21:02:26	zchrykng	I have a big windows desktop I'm not willing to replace unless I can get something close to the same power. :/
2018-02-26 21:02:45	jrg	or at least had some sort of 500-1TB SSD option.. that l2arc platter makes me kind of sick
2018-02-26 21:02:49	jrg	and 256 is too small
2018-02-26 21:03:08	jrg	i just use my late 2013 mbp heh
2018-02-26 21:03:24	jrg	the thing is still a trooper.. i have an imac that I’m waiting on an SSD for that should show tomorrow
2018-02-26 21:03:30	jrg	the platter is ass slow
2018-02-26 21:03:58	jrg	I’d have rather had a 128GB SSD than this disgusting platter apple used in this late 2013 imac i have
2018-02-26 21:05:08	jrg	at least make the damn thing easy to swap apple :)
2018-02-26 21:05:14	jrg	guess those days are over now tho
2018-02-26 21:09:48	zchrykng	jrg: Supposedly an updated Mac Pro is coming, probably this year, that will be "modular" whatever that means in Apple marketing speak.
2018-02-26 21:10:37	jrg	pay to play I’m sure.
