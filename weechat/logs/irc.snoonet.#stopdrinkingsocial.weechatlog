2018-03-23 15:11:05	ForDB	That's nuts.  I need to reach out to them.
2018-03-23 15:11:20	Talie	There's a few mental health issues that I believe they prefer not to take on
2018-03-23 15:12:01	ForDB	That's fair and reasonable and I don't want to go against their rules.
2018-03-23 15:12:38	ForDB	But outside of alcoholism, I don't have any mental health struggles outside of anxiety.  Or I don't think I do.
2018-03-23 15:12:53	hyggeheidi	i cannot find any flights to that airport they recommend in greece from zurich
2018-03-23 15:13:19	hyggeheidi	i think google is glitching

2018-03-23 15:15:07	zzzeyez	there is this guy who is suing google, and i was googling his name and someone had altered the titles of results to insult him
2018-03-23 15:15:10	hyggeheidi	200-300 for round trip in april
2018-03-23 15:15:31	ForDB	to athens?
2018-03-23 15:15:43	hyggeheidi	yes

2018-03-23 15:16:07	hyggeheidi	that's pretty funny zzzeyez
2018-03-23 15:16:41	ForDB	So from Toronto there I can find about $1500 CAD - like 2000 CFK
2018-03-23 15:17:07	hyggeheidi	you should be able to find cheaper
2018-03-23 15:17:29	hyggeheidi	i can normally find canada-here around 500
2018-03-23 15:18:08	hyggeheidi	i found toronto-athens for 746 
2018-03-23 15:18:15	ForDB	I did a really quick look, I'm sure if I look harder there's lower.  It was also the default search for next week haha
2018-03-23 15:18:20	hyggeheidi	april 8-12
2018-03-23 15:18:21	ForDB	That's not bad at all.
2018-03-23 15:19:00	ForDB	Okay I'm getting way ahead of myself.
2018-03-23 15:19:06	hyggeheidi	i am american living in europe so i am always trying to find tickets connecting our continents lol

2018-03-23 15:20:01	ForDB	The last time I was in Europe I made someone else book the tickets for me haha, I hate the whole experience.
2018-03-23 15:20:54	hyggeheidi	totally understand
2018-03-23 15:20:59	hyggeheidi	i hate that i know so much about it now
2018-03-23 15:21:02	ForDB	I need to have a solid amount of sobriety going on again before I can even think about this idea... but what a nice reward this could be!
2018-03-23 15:21:27	ForDB	If you think you didn't just get added to my "hit list" of people to ask for help, you're wrong :P
2018-03-23 15:21:32	hyggeheidi	an amazing reward yes! it is important to have something to look forward to i think and treat yourself
2018-03-23 15:21:43	hyggeheidi	please do :)
2018-03-23 15:21:59	hyggeheidi	the first time i traveled after getting sober was only a month in
2018-03-23 15:22:08	hyggeheidi	i found a flight to amsterdam from atlanta for 300 dollars
2018-03-23 15:22:23	hyggeheidi	went with my new lover (who is now my husband)
2018-03-23 15:23:02	hyggeheidi	such an amazing trip. went to this small island called texel in the netherlands. was cold but clear and sunny and so beautiful.
2018-03-23 15:23:26	ForDB	That's awesome!  My BF has never been to Europe, but would also neeeeeever consider going to a retreat or anything and that's what I'd really like to do.
2018-03-23 15:23:28	hyggeheidi	but i have heard it is best to stay sober for a year or so before traveling
2018-03-23 15:23:50	ForDB	I've heard that too, especially because I don't want to be away from accountability.
2018-03-23 15:24:09	hyggeheidi	sobriety is always most important to protect by all means necessary
2018-03-23 15:24:29	ForDB	I don't know if I'd wait that long, but... yeah.  Also I think travelling is different from travelling to go on a retreat.  I'd want one that was away from everything.
2018-03-23 15:24:50	ForDB	Hence the Costa Rica interest - lots of little places away from bad options and choices to just chill out and reboot.
2018-03-23 15:24:56	hyggeheidi	but if after a period of time you do feel ready, i think a yoga and wellness retreat with likeminded people would be a perfect reward for sobriety!
2018-03-23 15:25:38	hyggeheidi	yes. and with the retreat being health and wellness focused you are surrounded by others who are also committed to sobriety during this trip
2018-03-23 15:25:46	hyggeheidi	it's a perfect combination
2018-03-23 15:26:00	hyggeheidi	exploring, traveling, exercising, and practicing sobriety 
2018-03-23 15:26:21	hyggeheidi	i think it's also a good way to travel while you are re-learning to trust yourself
2018-03-23 15:26:37	hyggeheidi	i want to go so bad these look so amazing omg
2018-03-23 15:26:37	ForDB	Yes absolutely!  Realistically and assuming I keep going the way I am, I'd be thinking July-August.  And I'd want to go alone or with people who are sober/recovering.
2018-03-23 15:26:42	ForDB	I KNOWWWWWW

2018-04-13 09:56:38	@gabby756	so the ban was due to repeated rules violations

2018-04-13 10:03:54	metoo	hey I got pre-cooked mini-shrimp. I'm still supposed to fry those, right?
2018-04-13 10:04:40	Theiaa	nah
2018-04-13 10:04:45	Theiaa	Just put in the micro
2018-04-13 10:04:48	Theiaa	and eat dem
2018-04-13 10:04:58	Theiaa	You could possibly just eat out of package
2018-04-13 10:05:18	Theiaa	by fry you don't mean deep fry right?
2018-04-13 10:05:27	Theiaa	Bc for some reason I thought you meant fry fry
2018-04-13 10:05:45	metoo	pan fry
2018-04-13 10:06:05	metoo	but pan frying is okay, no? I would like to marinade them first in cajun spice mix
2018-04-13 10:06:05	Theiaa	yeah do that
2018-04-13 10:06:14	Theiaa	Oh sounds good
2018-04-13 10:06:26	metoo	I suppose if they're edible unfried, it'd be mostly high heat frying after letting them sit in the spices for a while
2018-04-13 10:06:44	metoo	for some reason I'm very paranoid about undercooking/frying this new thing in my life :)
2018-04-13 10:06:52	Theiaa	hahah
2018-04-13 10:06:54	Theiaa	So cute
2018-04-13 10:07:03	Theiaa	no if it says pre cooked
2018-04-13 10:07:05	metoo	mostly annoying :P
2018-04-13 10:07:05	Theiaa	You should be ok
2018-04-13 10:07:32	metoo	but yeah, I figured pre-cooked meant edible because they also had 'cocktail shrimp' which were a bit larger, but also pre-cooked
2018-04-13 10:07:40	metoo	so it's all extra then
2018-04-13 10:07:47	Theiaa	Idk I would just sear it tbh
2018-04-13 10:07:52	Theiaa	Or grill 
2018-04-13 10:07:59	Theiaa	im not sure what the proper terminology is here
2018-04-13 10:07:59	metoo	searing! that's the word I was looking for
2018-04-13 10:08:19	metoo	I was going to save them for tomorrow, but I might just make some this evening
2018-04-13 10:08:20	Theiaa	Yeah like get that good brown/goldenish color going
2018-04-13 10:08:24	metoo	thanks :)
2018-04-13 10:08:33	Theiaa	do it :) 
2018-04-13 10:08:42	metoo	they're the really tiny cute ones (apparently the only ones we have over here)
2018-04-13 10:08:52	Theiaa	ahh
2018-04-13 10:09:02	Theiaa	Maybe a salad or something then? 
2018-04-13 10:09:10	Theiaa	i mean what are you doing with them after you cook them :P
2018-04-13 10:09:22	metoo	as a dutch person I'll probably put them on some bread. with some kind of sauce.
2018-04-13 10:09:38	Theiaa	Hahah sounds delicious
2018-04-13 10:09:42	Theiaa	i do that all the time
2018-04-13 10:09:42	metoo	although I did find marinating didn't work too well last time. like it just stuck to the outside of the shrimp
2018-04-13 10:09:46	Theiaa	But I don't fry them
2018-04-13 10:09:54	metoo	I got sriracha mayo which goes well with the whole thing
2018-04-13 10:10:11	metoo	I might try some unfried soon. could be a good snack

2018-04-13 10:13:47	ElecR	do you mean cooked and chilled?

2018-04-13 10:14:23	Theiaa	That's what I meant I think

2018-04-13 10:14:31	Theiaa	All shellfish can be eaten raw
2018-04-13 10:14:31	ElecR	Yeah like shrimp cocktail
2018-04-13 10:14:35	Theiaa	from what I recall
2018-04-13 10:14:38	ElecR	maybe
2018-04-13 10:14:46	Theiaa	Google will know the answer
2018-04-13 10:14:50	ElecR	I still "cook" shrimp in acid for ceviche
2018-04-13 10:15:04	ElecR	and it's boiled in the sushi I've had
2018-04-13 10:15:18	ElecR	but I've never had em like an oyster or anything
2018-04-13 10:15:20	metoo	I only know of eating sushi and dutch herring raw
2018-04-13 10:15:25	metoo	oh, and oysters!
2018-04-13 10:15:31	ElecR	is the herring pickled?
2018-04-13 10:15:35	metoo	salted
2018-04-13 10:15:43	ElecR	chemical cooking!
2018-04-13 10:15:45	ElecR	neato!
2018-04-13 10:15:58	metoo	it's one of the few dutch cuisine things I'm proud of
2018-04-13 10:16:02	Theiaa	haha
2018-04-13 10:16:03	ElecR	I tried brine preserving some corn and failed. :(
2018-04-13 10:16:06	ElecR	It molded
2018-04-13 10:16:17	ElecR	went down the in sink erator
2018-04-13 10:16:34	metoo	so for cajun mini-shrimp, how long would i let them sit with the cajun spice mix?
2018-04-13 10:16:37	metoo	about 30 mins or so?
2018-04-13 10:16:53	ElecR	longer the better
2018-04-13 10:17:02	metoo	ugh
2018-04-13 10:17:08	ElecR	but the shrimp's already cooked so it's not gonna soak in the cooking process
2018-04-13 10:17:12	metoo	last time I did 30 mins and it felt like it didn't marinate at all
2018-04-13 10:17:19	ElecR	so the cajun will be more a sauce than a marinade anyway
2018-04-13 10:17:21	metoo	just shrimp with delicious spices caked to the outsides
2018-04-13 10:17:33	metoo	yeah, the no soaking I'm not a fan of
2018-04-13 10:17:50	metoo	with chicken this all seems much easier

2018-04-13 10:21:18	gonzobot	(metoo) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
2018-04-13 10:21:20	Theiaa	hahah
2018-04-13 10:21:27	metoo	dot throwing me off :-/
2018-04-13 10:21:31	Theiaa	How come we are chilling here metoo?
2018-04-13 10:21:34	Theiaa	everything ok?
2018-04-13 10:21:45	metoo	quieter in here
2018-04-13 10:22:33	metoo	also, figured food advice was off-topic :)
2018-04-13 10:22:57	metoo	okay, so google translate tells me '4 tablespoons flush'
2018-04-13 10:22:57	Theiaa	I like it quieter too
2018-04-13 10:23:01	metoo	I think that one is cream, no?
2018-04-13 10:23:09	Theiaa	sometimes its fun with the cross talk
2018-04-13 10:23:15	Theiaa	When there is actual cross talk
2018-04-13 10:23:16	metoo	rømme
2018-04-13 10:23:24	metoo	yeah, it's nice to have both
2018-04-13 10:23:26	Theiaa	and not just people complaining or detailing every minute of their lives
2018-04-13 10:23:36	metoo	and sometimes the channels 'flip'
2018-04-13 10:23:41	Theiaa	ikr!
2018-04-13 10:23:50	metoo	it's fascinating
2018-04-13 10:24:15	Theiaa	Yeah rømme is cream
2018-04-13 10:24:26	metoo	I don't have cream or dille :-/
2018-04-13 10:24:34	metoo	might get some tomorrow though
2018-04-13 10:24:58	metoo	actually the original page is easier to parse than the translated one
2018-04-13 10:25:05	metoo	very similar to dutch
2018-04-13 10:25:17	Theiaa	It's sour cream though
2018-04-13 10:25:22	Theiaa	not cream cream
2018-04-13 10:25:25	metoo	I could get some tomorrow or the day after
2018-04-13 10:25:36	metoo	this recipe is better with the bigger shrimp, no?
2018-04-13 10:25:44	Theiaa	No tiny shrimp
2018-04-13 10:25:45	metoo	I got the really tiny cute dutch ones, and slightly bigger ones
2018-04-13 10:27:39	metoo	would it be worth it getting proper prawns for this, or are the 'slightly bigger ones' okay (the 'big' ones I have are about the size of a... big coin? so still kinda small)
2018-04-13 10:27:59	metoo	the proper big ones freak me out a bit, with their tails and all
2018-04-13 10:28:32	Theiaa	yeah the coin size would work
2018-04-13 10:28:36	Theiaa	You don't want the jumbo ones
2018-04-13 10:28:40	Theiaa	for this one
2018-04-13 10:29:00	metoo	perfect
2018-04-13 10:29:12	metoo	I'm trying to challenge myself to go for the jumbo ones soon though
2018-04-13 10:29:16	metoo	one step at a time
2018-04-13 10:29:34	metoo	I had those BBQ'd before, and they were great. just... daunting.

2018-04-13 10:30:31	Theiaa	mayo*
2018-04-13 10:30:47	metoo	yeah, for the dutch shrimp today that's my plan :)
2018-04-13 10:30:48	Theiaa	Instead of rømme
2018-04-13 10:30:53	metoo	aah
2018-04-13 10:31:05	Theiaa	it's like quick fix
2018-04-13 10:31:09	Theiaa	But delicious
2018-04-13 10:31:11	metoo	dutch mayo might not be sour enough
2018-04-13 10:31:21	Theiaa	I just have a premade
2018-04-13 10:31:27	Theiaa	we have loads of premade here
2018-04-13 10:31:42	Theiaa	Put some butter on bread put rekesalat on said bread
2018-04-13 10:31:43	Theiaa	then eat it
2018-04-13 10:31:59	metoo	yeah that's the weekend plan :)
2018-04-13 10:32:07	Theiaa	Mayo isn't sour though is it?
2018-04-13 10:32:10	Theiaa	im no food expect tbh
2018-04-13 10:32:12	metoo	I might go shopping and get the specific sour cream
2018-04-13 10:32:18	Theiaa	I don't even know how to cook chicken
2018-04-13 10:32:30	metoo	well, there's different kinds of mayo here at least. the dutch one is not too sour, but the belgian one is, I think
2018-04-13 10:32:49	Theiaa	Do you guys have cheese tubes?
2018-04-13 10:32:57	metoo	for the frying butter > olive oil, no?
2018-04-13 10:33:01	Theiaa	does your mayo come in a tube?
2018-04-13 10:33:10	metoo	I think I've seen them, but dutch people are suspicious of that :P
2018-04-13 10:33:13	Theiaa	Idk depends on your pan tbh
2018-04-13 10:33:19	metoo	we have tube mayo, yes
2018-04-13 10:33:22	metoo	mostly it's jars though
2018-04-13 10:33:22	Theiaa	norwegians fucking love their tubes
2018-04-13 10:33:32	Theiaa	It's sooooo suspicious
2018-04-13 10:33:32	@NOVACyclist	butter has a lower smoke point due to the milk solids
2018-04-13 10:33:45	Theiaa	I would use olive oil
2018-04-13 10:33:51	metoo	it's a different taste though, no? I find steak with butter preferable, for example
2018-04-13 10:33:52	Theiaa	i always burn butter
2018-04-13 10:34:05	@NOVACyclist	a good combo is to mix both
2018-04-13 10:34:12	@NOVACyclist	a little butter in your olive oil
2018-04-13 10:34:14	metoo	hmm. yeah, the one pan I have left (pile of dishes) burns stuff quickly
2018-04-13 10:34:19	@NOVACyclist	or fry in the olive, and finish w/ butter
2018-04-13 10:34:19	metoo	maybe because it's ceramic?
2018-04-13 10:34:27	metoo	ah, I'll try that
2018-04-13 10:34:27	@NOVACyclist	butter has more flavor
2018-04-13 10:34:33	@NOVACyclist	also don't use good olive oil for frying
2018-04-13 10:34:39	Theiaa	Butter > everything
2018-04-13 10:34:40	metoo	how so?
2018-04-13 10:34:42	@NOVACyclist	it is a waste of money
2018-04-13 10:34:49	@NOVACyclist	the flavor doesn't come across
2018-04-13 10:34:53	metoo	right
2018-04-13 10:34:53	@NOVACyclist	keep the good oil for dipping
2018-04-13 10:34:57	@NOVACyclist	and some cheaper for frying
2018-04-13 10:35:05	Theiaa	they different types of olive oils too though
2018-04-13 10:35:12	Theiaa	ones that fry better etc
2018-04-13 10:35:14	@NOVACyclist	Yes
2018-04-13 10:35:19	metoo	I only have the fancy olive oil, but mostly when it comes to food I don't try to be frugal these days
2018-04-13 10:35:28	metoo	extra virgin?
2018-04-13 10:35:29	@NOVACyclist	the expensive first cold pressing stuff is too nice for the pan
2018-04-13 10:35:38	@NOVACyclist	you can certainly use it
2018-04-13 10:35:46	Theiaa	Yeah what nova said
2018-04-13 10:35:51	@NOVACyclist	but if you wanna be a little thrifty
2018-04-13 10:35:53	Theiaa	the good oil is for salads
2018-04-13 10:35:56	metoo	I'm so bad at eating that I indulge massively
2018-04-13 10:35:59	@NOVACyclist	some bargain olive oil for frying is just fine too
2018-04-13 10:36:37	Theiaa	I never use butter bc I burn i
2018-04-13 10:36:38	Theiaa	it
2018-04-13 10:36:47	metoo	so I'd use olive oil and then add some butter shortly before the shrimp are done frying?
2018-04-13 10:36:54	@NOVACyclist	yeah
2018-04-13 10:37:03	Theiaa	will try that in the future nova
2018-04-13 10:37:03	@NOVACyclist	you'll be much less likely to burn it that way
2018-04-13 10:37:06	Theiaa	Thanks for the tip
2018-04-13 10:37:18	@NOVACyclist	get your frying done then you could add the butter to finish off heat
2018-04-13 10:37:20	metoo	yeah, burning was a big problem in the past, especially with this ceramic pan
2018-04-13 10:37:28	@NOVACyclist	there should be plenty of heat left in the pan
2018-04-13 10:37:35	metoo	right
2018-04-13 10:37:36	@NOVACyclist	a tablespoon for flavor will melt nicely
2018-04-13 10:38:00	ElecR	careful not to cook the shrimpies very long since they're precooked
2018-04-13 10:38:00	metoo	any tips on how to get shrimp to actually marinade?
2018-04-13 10:38:08	ElecR	they'll turn into tough lil nuggets in no time
2018-04-13 10:38:11	@NOVACyclist	I buy raw frozen shrimp and make a quick shrimp and pasta dish
2018-04-13 10:38:12	metoo	yeah, about 2-3 mins on high heat, no?
2018-04-13 10:38:22	@NOVACyclist	2-3 min is all you need for raw shrimp
2018-04-13 10:38:28	metoo	these are precooked
2018-04-13 10:38:34	@NOVACyclist	so that is too long
2018-04-13 10:38:41	@NOVACyclist	you just want a little color/flavor
2018-04-13 10:38:46	metoo	ah, really?
2018-04-13 10:38:53	metoo	I do think I overdid it last time
2018-04-13 10:38:57	ElecR	just a nice color and warmth
2018-04-13 10:38:58	metoo	so just more of a searing thing
2018-04-13 10:39:01	metoo	like with steak
2018-04-13 10:39:04	ElecR	just presentation
2018-04-13 10:39:12	ElecR	they're already safe to eat
2018-04-13 10:39:24	metoo	is there any way to actually get the shrimp to soak up the spices? add some water to the bowl?
2018-04-13 10:39:50	ElecR	cook some rice with the spices, too
2018-04-13 10:39:51	metoo	I quite liked the end result, but it didn't taste like the shrimp actually 'soaked up' anything
2018-04-13 10:40:11	metoo	felt like I might as well have added the spices during frying
2018-04-13 10:40:26	ElecR	or during presentation
2018-04-13 10:40:27	metoo	(I gave 'em 30 mins last time)
2018-04-13 10:40:35	metoo	yeah, or that
2018-04-13 10:40:47	ElecR	depending on the spices
2018-04-13 10:40:59	@NOVACyclist	marinades need time to work
2018-04-13 10:41:01	metoo	it was still a nice change from chicken or steak, but still
2018-04-13 10:41:03	@NOVACyclist	4-6 hours
2018-04-13 10:41:47	metoo	hmm, yeah... so next time I would put shrimp in a bowl, add cajun spices (or anything else), mash it up, put them in the fridge for 4-6 hours?
2018-04-13 10:42:03	metoo	I could try that tomorrow
2018-04-13 10:42:40	metoo	or sunday, and take them to work for lunch
2018-04-13 10:42:42	ElecR	you could put them to marinade in the fridge right now and they'd be badass tomorrow
2018-04-13 10:42:49	ElecR	just cover the bowl with some plastic wrap
2018-04-13 10:42:54	metoo	cool
2018-04-13 10:43:01	metoo	this is all new information to me :)
2018-04-13 10:43:16	ElecR	I learn mostly by trial and error
2018-04-13 10:43:20	ElecR	and cooking shows on tv
2018-04-13 10:43:27	-->	Wincil (uid220396@user/Wincil) has joined #stopdrinkingsocial
2018-04-13 10:43:27	metoo	it would've never occurred to me to leave them that long
2018-04-13 10:43:28	ElecR	and google right before I go to the store
2018-04-13 10:43:30	 *	ShaleRocksBot welcomes Wincil to the room.
2018-04-13 10:43:39	metoo	any downside to leaving them like that in the fridge for 2 days?
2018-04-13 10:44:40	metoo	I think I'll buy some extra shrimp tomorrow and properly marinate them so I can entice myself to go to the office on monday to fry them
2018-04-13 10:44:48	ElecR	hmm not sure. They're all flash frozen before they're sold so I try to keep them frozen until I need them
2018-04-13 10:44:50	metoo	two birds one stone type deal
2018-04-13 10:45:22	metoo	I've heard that buying them here unfrozen means 2 days at most in the fridge
2018-04-13 10:45:33	ElecR	sounds about right
2018-04-13 10:45:52	ElecR	they get kinda watery and don't cook up right
2018-04-13 10:46:05	metoo	cool, thanks for the advice! it would've never occurred to me, for some reason, to let them marinade overnight
2018-04-13 10:46:31	metoo	while I did know that principle when it comes to some broths/slow cooky stuff
2018-04-13 10:46:37	ElecR	IMO the best cooking takes a really, really long time to do, but for 99% of that time you're just waiting
2018-04-13 10:46:46	Wincil	.bef
2018-04-13 10:46:46	gonzobot	(Wincil) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
2018-04-13 10:47:00	ElecR	I want to get a sous vide heater
2018-04-13 10:47:02	metoo	well, I need to slow down my life anyways, so that's probably helpful :)
2018-04-13 10:47:31	metoo	I found a bunch of recipes that tell me to leave my multi-cooker on 'slow cook' for a day or so and I've been meaning to try one of those
2018-04-13 10:47:53	metoo	some pasta sauces iirc
2018-04-13 10:48:09	ElecR	low and slow is the way to go!
2018-04-13 10:48:16	metoo	haha
2018-04-13 10:48:24	ElecR	I'm thinking of getting a pork loin and slow cooking it
2018-04-13 10:48:34	ElecR	but can't decide where to go from there
2018-04-13 10:48:42	ElecR	did spicy for pork tacos last time
2018-04-13 10:48:52	metoo	srlsly though, thanks for the advice. I'm very anxious about cooking and outside of here I have one friend that I approach about these things.
2018-04-13 10:49:01	ElecR	no worries!
2018-04-13 10:49:08	ElecR	my best lessons were fuck ups
2018-04-13 10:49:14	ElecR	be proud of failure
2018-04-13 10:49:30	metoo	but it feels like something I can get excited about to a degree that it's a good sobriety 'tool' :)
2018-04-13 10:49:37	@NOVACyclist	I've learned much more through my failures than sucesses
2018-04-13 10:49:41	metoo	(well, can and do)
2018-04-13 10:49:47	@NOVACyclist	embrace them and learn from them
2018-04-13 10:49:51	@NOVACyclist	don't hide
2018-04-13 10:50:13	@NOVACyclist	this applies to life, work, cooking, etc.
2018-04-13 10:50:43	metoo	yeah
2018-04-13 10:50:50	metoo	I am terrible at failing
2018-04-13 10:50:53	ElecR	Also if there's any way that you can find old episodes of Juila Child and/or Jacques Pepin cooking watch those!
2018-04-13 10:50:56	metoo	I made the most awful tom yum the other day, for example
2018-04-13 10:51:06	metoo	undercooked shrimp, too much water, etc.
2018-04-13 10:51:20	ElecR	was it for a big crowd?
2018-04-13 10:51:21	metoo	it was kind of empowering to fail so terribly
2018-04-13 10:51:26	metoo	oh no, just myself
2018-04-13 10:51:32	ElecR	perfect
2018-04-13 10:51:34	metoo	I'm my worst critic!
2018-04-13 10:51:36	ElecR	best way to fail imo
2018-04-13 10:51:38	ElecR	lol
2018-04-13 10:51:43	metoo	my stomach got quite upset but nothing too bad :)
2018-04-13 10:51:50	ElecR	practice makes mediocre
2018-04-13 10:51:54	metoo	but cooking is definitely 'out there' for me.
2018-04-13 10:51:56	ElecR	and then decent
2018-04-13 10:52:02	metoo	baking I've done and aced on the first try
2018-04-13 10:52:07	ElecR	not me!
2018-04-13 10:52:15	metoo	cooking is infuriatingly 'vague' to me
2018-04-13 10:52:28	ElecR	like the term "al dente"
2018-04-13 10:52:33	metoo	yes!
2018-04-13 10:52:35	ElecR	literally means "to tooth"
2018-04-13 10:52:46	ElecR	and I know *exactly* what that is. :)
2018-04-13 10:52:49	metoo	don't get me started on that shit
2018-04-13 10:52:55	ElecR	I can feel it in my teeth
2018-04-13 10:52:56	ElecR	lol
2018-04-13 10:53:06	metoo	but I do have to admit when I got it right, it felt like a real victory
2018-04-13 10:53:30	metoo	like I can cook decent fishey stuff + rice + various sauces
2018-04-13 10:53:49	ElecR	I cooked a lot for the years when I lived with my SO
2018-04-13 10:53:54	ElecR	then absolutely none for years
2018-04-13 10:54:07	metoo	did the practice 'stick'?
2018-04-13 10:54:13	ElecR	literally didn't turn on a stove for over two years
2018-04-13 10:54:25	ElecR	like riding a bike though
2018-04-13 10:54:32	metoo	right
2018-04-13 10:54:37	ElecR	I could cook as good as ever right after the two year gap
2018-04-13 10:54:49	ElecR	yes good
2018-04-13 10:54:50	ElecR	not well
2018-04-13 10:54:51	ElecR	lol
2018-04-13 10:55:02	metoo	that makes sense
2018-04-13 10:55:26	metoo	I'm still pretty new to cooking. so far steaming has been easy and delicious.
2018-04-13 10:55:56	metoo	I still mostly just google frantically and add spices as instructed. I think there's some progress there, but it's infuriatingly vague
2018-04-13 10:56:01	metoo	'add to taste' type stuff
2018-04-13 10:56:25	ElecR	I try to figure out what each spice/herb/fat/etc adds to the taste individually
2018-04-13 10:56:29	ElecR	and which ones I like
2018-04-13 10:57:04	ElecR	when people ask me for recipes there are lots of caveats like "i like it hot" or "there is a lot of garlic in mine"
2018-04-13 10:57:30	ElecR	making rubs/marinades/spice mixes with a little food processor is funnnnn
2018-04-13 10:58:52	metoo	hmm, experimenting with the spices/etc. individually does tickle my brain a bit more than the vague 'add a bunch of stuff to taste'
2018-04-13 10:59:24	Theiaa	i love garlic
2018-04-13 10:59:34	Theiaa	You can never have too much garlic
2018-04-13 10:59:35	metoo	I find myself mostly just too confused by the number of variables in the end result. I can't tell what worked and what didn't
2018-04-13 10:59:39	ElecR	figure out what cardamom tastes like. what tumeric tastes like. how cilantro and coriander are the same yet different
2018-04-13 10:59:49	metoo	oh yeah, garlic is always good!
2018-04-13 10:59:53	ElecR	what the hell "allspice" is
2018-04-13 11:00:03	Theiaa	i thought cilantro and coriander was the same
2018-04-13 11:00:08	Theiaa	Mind blown
2018-04-13 11:00:11	metoo	they are, I think
2018-04-13 11:00:15	ElecR	cilantro is the leaves coriander is the seed
2018-04-13 11:00:21	metoo	ElecR: how do you try these individually though?
2018-04-13 11:00:23	ElecR	big difference, and yet not

2018-04-13 11:00:30	Theiaa	FACT
2018-04-13 11:00:31	metoo	wow, really?
2018-04-13 11:00:46	metoo	I thought they were the same, conversationally
2018-04-13 11:00:53	ElecR	if you go to the store here and buy cilantro it will be fresh in the veggie section.
2018-04-13 11:01:00	metoo	soapy to some, delicious to others.
2018-04-13 11:01:02	ElecR	Coriander is in the spice aisle and is the seeds
2018-04-13 11:01:22	ElecR	Soapy to me, but I have to get over that personally because it is so prevalent in cuisine here
2018-04-13 11:01:45	metoo	is that something you can get over?
2018-04-13 11:01:56	metoo	I thought it was genetically predetermined
2018-04-13 11:02:00	ElecR	not so far lol
2018-04-13 11:02:15	ElecR	I have to make myself like things I don't like, if you will

2018-04-13 11:04:48	metoo	aww
2018-04-13 11:05:45	metoo	I decided to go cook anyways. 40 mins of marinating at least :). will try overnight soon though.
2018-04-13 11:06:20	metoo	watch some Legion
2018-04-13 11:06:43	ElecR	Best of luck!

2018-04-13 14:01:57	ErryTime	if you do not mind sending a modmail to www.reddit.com/r/sdirc we will reconsider your case. Please know: your ban may stay in place...

2018-04-14 04:27:34	gonzobot	・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_ó​< QUAC​K!
2018-04-14 04:27:36	Thea	.bang
2018-04-14 04:27:37	gonzobot	Thea you shot a duck in 3.092 seconds! You have killed 86 ducks in #stopdrinkingsocial.
2018-04-14 04:27:52	metoo	lol
2018-04-14 04:27:54	metoo	dammit
2018-04-14 04:27:59	Thea	So my friend suggested I should ask for shadowing there
2018-04-14 04:28:05	Thea	and that might be my in
2018-04-14 04:28:24	Thea	And that regardless it will show you are really interested in working there
2018-04-14 04:28:24	metoo	shadowing would  be kind of like an unpaid internship?
2018-04-14 04:29:01	Thea	yeah
2018-04-14 04:29:07	Thea	But you just shadow
2018-04-14 04:29:08	metoo	sounds like good advice
2018-04-14 04:29:10	Thea	so you don't get to do anything
2018-04-14 04:29:13	metoo	right
2018-04-14 04:29:15	Thea	Just sit in the background kind of thing
2018-04-14 04:29:18	metoo	that makes sense, I guess
2018-04-14 04:29:33	metoo	I've said/done the same kind of thing
2018-04-14 04:29:46	metoo	once you're 'in' and get to know people it's so much easier to get hired
2018-04-14 04:31:37	Thea	yeah like make an impression on them
2018-04-14 04:31:44	Thea	And the Norwegians love americans
2018-04-14 04:31:51	metoo	haha
2018-04-14 04:31:53	metoo	yeah?
2018-04-14 04:31:56	Thea	def
2018-04-14 04:32:02	Thea	They dream of living in the states
2018-04-14 04:32:08	Thea	which is so stupid
2018-04-14 04:32:22	metoo	moreso than, say, the swedes or danes?
2018-04-14 04:32:26	metoo	I get that impression
2018-04-14 04:32:26	Thea	norway is so much better to live
2018-04-14 04:32:35	Thea	idk
2018-04-14 04:32:39	Thea	maybe
2018-04-14 04:32:41	Thea	anwyay
2018-04-14 04:32:44	Thea	So my problem here is 
2018-04-14 04:32:56	Thea	well first I'm going to send him an email on I was thinking Tuesday next week
2018-04-14 04:33:36	Thea	ok background info: I am planning on working like crazy for a few weeks back to back shifts not much free time so that I can get 2 weeks off 
2018-04-14 04:33:44	Thea	Since I don't technically get paid vacation this year
2018-04-14 04:33:50	metoo	right
2018-04-14 04:33:56	Thea	and was planning on going back to the states
2018-04-14 04:34:06	Thea	Since I don't know when ill be able to go again
2018-04-14 04:34:13	Thea	back to the states
2018-04-14 04:34:43	metoo	ah, so soon?
2018-04-14 04:35:57	Thea	yeah i know
2018-04-14 04:36:09	Thea	But like I said I have to work in the summer bc people go on vacation
2018-04-14 04:36:27	Thea	so idk when ill be able to go again
2018-04-14 04:36:32	metoo	right, makes sense then
2018-04-14 04:37:01	Thea	Anyway the thing is if he says yes ofc come over in may ... then I can't go back
2018-04-14 04:37:38	metoo	well surely if you're shadowing you could do that after you get back, no?
2018-04-14 04:38:50	Thea	yeah I could do that as well actually
2018-04-14 04:39:07	Thea	Idk just so confused by the email still haha
2018-04-14 04:39:07	metoo	:)
2018-04-14 04:39:10	Thea	he really put me off
2018-04-14 04:39:31	Thea	I just expected sorry we hired someone else you didn't make the cut please do apply again in the future and good luck 
2018-04-14 04:39:54	metoo	yeah it sounded really positive
2018-04-14 04:40:11	metoo	hell maybe it's just some industries but I've heard plenty of stories where you don't even hear back
2018-04-14 04:40:23	metoo	then you call and they're all 'oh yeah we found someone else. good luck!'
2018-04-14 04:42:59	Thea	my so thinks if he says yes to shadowing then I shouldn't go back
2018-04-14 04:43:09	Thea	And do 2 weeks in a row so that I get continuity 
2018-04-14 04:43:24	Thea	and then after that do 25% shadowing
2018-04-14 04:44:02	metoo	you think that'd work better? the continuity?
2018-04-14 04:44:38	Thea	idk
2018-04-14 04:44:44	Thea	I have never shadowed like that
2018-04-14 04:44:55	Thea	i did shadowing like whenever I got the chance
2018-04-14 04:45:02	Thea	But spent entire days 
2018-04-14 04:45:08	Thea	got to see more stuff that way
2018-04-14 04:45:38	metoo	maybe you could ask in the email?
2018-04-14 04:45:49	metoo	or first ask if shadowing is an option, and when they say yes, ask this

2018-04-21 22:41:17	malapropist	aww
2018-04-21 22:41:19	RhinoVaccine	It's starting to happen more often
2018-04-21 22:41:26	RhinoVaccine	 the crew I got sober with is "moving on"
2018-04-21 22:41:34	RhinoVaccine	more and more newer people
2018-04-21 22:41:42	malapropist	i guess people kinda don't know what way to take the things you say sometimes
2018-04-21 22:41:49	RhinoVaccine	and I'm running out of energy to "train people" to AlienRhino
2018-04-21 22:41:57	RhinoVaccine	"no one ever does"
2018-04-21 22:41:59	malapropist	i know, right? sometimes i log in and it's like oh, there's a whole new cohort in here
2018-04-21 22:42:23	RhinoVaccine	so for a while a crew had me down
2018-04-21 22:42:31	RhinoVaccine	now I'm getting worn out :(
2018-04-21 22:42:53	malapropist	sorry to hear.
2018-04-21 22:43:05	RhinoVaccine	yeah well, I don't have THAT answer tonight either
2018-04-21 22:43:45	malapropist	we gotta keep on keeping on somehow
2018-04-21 22:43:45	malapropist	this room can't solve everything for us, as helpful as it is
2018-04-21 22:43:53	RhinoVaccine	so if this still matters to you in four days, I'll go to town
2018-04-21 22:44:46	malapropist	okay, we'll see. i'm starting to find what i need, i think
2018-04-21 22:44:46	malapropist	but i appreciate the offer
2018-04-21 22:44:52	RhinoVaccine	that's also one of my new strategies, out of necessity
2018-04-21 22:45:00	RhinoVaccine	well see okay
2018-04-21 22:45:29	malapropist	haha that was the answer whenever i asked for something as a kid... "we'll see"
2018-04-21 22:45:39	RhinoVaccine	because my mind is like a giant diesel Alien Spaceship engine, it doesn't start on a dime, but it won't stop on a dollar either
2018-04-21 22:45:56	malapropist	also known as "hopefully you'll just forget about this and i won't have to deal with being a parent for one more day"
2018-04-21 22:46:10	malapropist	lol that's a great turn of phrase
2018-04-21 22:46:24	RhinoVaccine	"I am training my kid to neurobiologically train his dopamine centers to be down regulated" :P
2018-04-21 22:46:51	RhinoVaccine	#Upshifting Words
2018-04-21 22:46:54	malapropist	is down regulated a good thing?
2018-04-21 22:46:57	RhinoVaccine	yes
2018-04-21 22:47:07	RhinoVaccine	"The Devil is in your Dopamine Center"
2018-04-21 22:47:21	RhinoVaccine	ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING EVER called "bad for you" is a Dopamine bomb
2018-04-21 22:47:27	RhinoVaccine	with some stuff along for the ride
2018-04-21 22:47:37	malapropist	don't be a dope for dopamine
2018-04-21 22:47:40	RhinoVaccine	It's harder to say what the good configs are
2018-04-21 22:47:43	RhinoVaccine	but something like that
2018-04-21 22:48:04	RhinoVaccine	"Devil in the Dopamine" for short
2018-04-21 22:48:15	RhinoVaccine	same letter is kinda neat
2018-04-21 22:48:47	RhinoVaccine	heh and see there's this limbo period
2018-04-21 22:49:04	RhinoVaccine	"the big Alien Engine is trying to fire up" and I'm not letting it
2018-04-21 22:49:07	RhinoVaccine	so it's kinda sputtering
2018-04-21 22:49:34		RhinoVaccine is now known as AlienRhino
2018-04-21 22:50:34	malapropist	what does "alienrhino" mean to you
2018-04-21 22:51:02	AlienRhino	... "the patron question of bad therapists" so I'm not sure if that's a joke or not!!
2018-04-21 22:51:29	AlienRhino	(ps they yelled at me for my dismay at therapy but you're a regular in Social not a newbie)
2018-04-21 22:51:36	malapropist	i'm just curious what it means for the alien engine to fire up
2018-04-21 22:52:02	AlienRhino	well I definitely like the Sci fi flair
2018-04-21 22:52:10	malapropist	well i know you've had your struggles with your psych care
2018-04-21 22:52:44	AlienRhino	mentally it feels like "oh, righto, medical monitors, here's four models, two have social features, one is cheaper, check your insurance, here is a 2 page report" : )
2018-04-21 22:53:19	malapropist	is alienrhino kind of like when you stop trying to fit in with normal conversation and let your language creativity out
2018-04-21 22:53:29	AlienRhino	"I called your doctor, he takes it, we got a coupon from the manufacturer, I called yoru Mom, she likes the third one but hates the price, but I got her on a good day, ps the arm band sucks but you can replace the arm band, and it comes in black if you use code 3356 when you order it : )
2018-04-21 22:53:33	AlienRhino	THe Big Alien Engine : )
2018-04-21 22:54:23	malapropist	ah so alienrhino is the more analytical part of your mind?
2018-04-21 22:54:50	malapropist	or just the part that gets shit done
2018-04-21 22:54:51	AlienRhino	Not only, but bigger creativity all around
2018-04-21 22:54:56	AlienRhino	ALL of it
2018-04-21 22:55:01	AlienRhino	it's what GOT me sober 
2018-04-21 22:55:14	malapropist	ah i see
2018-04-21 22:55:17	AlienRhino	"but no one wants to use the system but then they're back on Day one"
2018-04-21 22:55:36	AlienRhino	I ate a shoe four times last year
2018-04-21 22:55:53	AlienRhino	"Confucius say it very hard to drink vodka with shoe in your mouth"
2018-04-21 22:55:54	AlienRhino	: )
2018-04-21 22:56:16	malapropist	like you put your foot in your mouth or you literally ate shoes
2018-04-21 22:56:21	AlienRhino	yep
2018-04-21 22:56:37	AlienRhino	foot in mouth is a faux pas. This is fancy neuro bio trickery
2018-04-21 22:56:39	AlienRhino	but it works
2018-04-21 22:56:40	malapropist	haha "yes"
2018-04-21 22:57:01	AlienRhino	the fancy terminology is cognitive dissonance to force laughter
2018-04-21 22:57:15	AlienRhino	hehe I did it twice in rehav
2018-04-21 22:57:24	AlienRhino	to the amusemed terror of the counselors
2018-04-21 22:57:46	AlienRhino	my counter: "ANYTHING but drink RIGHT??" so pipe down" : )
2018-04-21 22:58:05	AlienRhino	"but you'll get sick
2018-04-21 22:58:15	AlienRhino	"fine. so I throw up. but I still have my 466 days"

2018-04-21 22:58:40	malapropist	fuck alcohol
2018-04-21 22:58:43	AlienRhino	(shocked silence) : )
2018-04-21 22:58:47	AlienRhino	AlienRhino WINS
2018-04-21 22:58:47	malapropist	i'm never degrading myself with that shit ever again
2018-04-21 22:59:07	malapropist	it's like i didn't realize i was worth anything, worth taking care of myself
2018-04-21 22:59:21	AlienRhino	I think the last time was a dark night in February 2 months ago
2018-04-21 22:59:34	malapropist	just a symptom of my self-destructive streak and basement level self-esteem
2018-04-21 22:59:34	AlienRhino	and that's why it's a BIG problem
2018-04-21 22:59:44	AlienRhino	I agree,
2018-04-21 23:00:17	AlienRhino	so that big convo ALSO has to wait but these are big alien topics
2018-04-21 23:00:21	malapropist	do you live in NYC?
2018-04-21 23:00:22	AlienRhino	but the room is tired of me
2018-04-21 23:00:24	AlienRhino	yep
2018-04-21 23:00:32	malapropist	haha
2018-04-21 23:00:45	malapropist	well that's cool, new york must be exciting to live in
2018-04-21 23:00:52	malapropist	totally different vibe than LA, where i'm from
2018-04-21 23:00:52	AlienRhino	yeah it is
2018-04-21 23:00:56	AlienRhino	took mondo getting used to
2018-04-21 23:01:17	malapropist	i remember hanging out in midtown, it's so exciting being around all the hustle and bustle
2018-04-21 23:01:21	malapropist	the feeling that everything in the world is happening right there right now
2018-04-21 23:01:39	malapropist	anything could happen, anyone could stroll by
2018-04-21 23:01:41	AlienRhino	that's this eerie illusion
2018-04-21 23:01:59	AlienRhino	after 9:22 pm it's bars
2018-04-21 23:02:10	malapropist	hah yeah it might be an illusion
2018-04-21 23:02:25	AlienRhino	well in the daytime it's true
2018-04-21 23:02:25	malapropist	i was still drinking when i went, and lemme tell you, people i met in manhattan bars were uniformly assholes
2018-04-21 23:02:40	AlienRhino	but you need a serious game plan for Cindarella Syndrome
2018-04-21 23:02:43	malapropist	like, they were just unpleasant, suspicious, agressive assholes
2018-04-21 23:04:24	AlienRhino	okay, make you a deal
2018-04-21 23:04:36	malapropist	ok
2018-04-21 23:04:42	AlienRhino	it actually kinda hurts to be in limbo between two styles
2018-04-21 23:04:57	AlienRhino	and the egine also needs more power (joke intended Scotty!) than I have
2018-04-21 23:04:59	AlienRhino	so lemme ander 
2018-04-21 23:05:06	AlienRhino	but if any of this matters to you in a few days, holler
2018-04-21 23:05:19	malapropist	alright, for sure.
2018-04-21 23:05:24	malapropist	thanks for the tip
2018-04-21 23:05:24	AlienRhino	and I'm on the verge of muting shale
2018-04-21 23:05:36	AlienRhino	so I can keep Social open
2018-04-21 23:05:57	AlienRhino	I can turn it off later
2018-04-21 23:06:06	AlienRhino	but the problem is social isn't used enough
2018-04-21 23:06:29	AlienRhino	and 18 blips of "new activity" but it's just shale wipes me out
2018-04-21 23:06:40	AlienRhino	so I'll keep it here
2018-04-21 23:06:42	AlienRhino	holler sometime

2018-05-07 20:08:01	RiverRapids	He has map dot fingerprint dystrophy and cysts on his cornea
2018-05-07 20:08:12	RiverRapids	And it was affecting his vision
2018-05-07 20:08:21	Rory36	Wow
2018-05-07 20:08:32	Rory36	Rough
2018-05-07 20:08:53	Rory36	We sure take vision for granted
2018-05-07 20:09:36	RiverRapids	So they had to remove the excess tissue and cysts. We are just hoping it resolves the issue. It’s something that could just grow back. He really worried he’s going to end up needing cornea transplants. But only time will tell
2018-05-07 20:09:45	RiverRapids	Definitely
2018-05-07 20:10:13	Rory36	That’s stressful but at least this one part is over with

2018-05-08 14:11:38	malapropist	if i didnt it was cuz i was broke

2018-05-08 14:12:12	malapropist	i tried to quit smoking and drinking once, and i went like 12 days, but was so sick the whole time
2018-05-08 14:12:15	incert	in hindsight I probably had withdrawals a few times without knowing it
2018-05-08 14:12:23	malapropist	apparently there's a thing called "smoker's flu"
2018-05-08 14:12:29	malapropist	that was fucking miserable
2018-05-08 14:12:37	malapropist	i eventually just gave up and went back to drinking

2018-05-08 14:15:26	incert	Much smoother
2018-05-08 14:15:50	malapropist	one thing i notice about myself is that i've been in bad situations in the past, where i felt down on myself or powerless
2018-05-08 14:16:13	malapropist	and then the situation changed but i held onto the feeling of powerlessness, even though it wasn't true anymore
2018-05-08 14:16:23	malapropist	i do that in more ways than just drinking
2018-05-08 14:16:37	malapropist	it's like an emotional hangover that lasts months if i let it
2018-05-08 14:16:58	malapropist	so even after i had longer term sobriety i still held on to all these limiting beliefs why drinking was better
2018-05-08 14:17:10	malapropist	i couldn't imagine actually being happier sober

2018-05-08 14:20:44	incert	You managed to sell it to yourself as that
2018-05-08 14:20:58	malapropist	what happened was after being sober, i started getting my life together, and then when things were good again, my brain would start lying to myself again, hey, what's the harm, you can relax, it'll be fine
2018-05-08 14:21:05	malapropist	and then i screwed everything up again
