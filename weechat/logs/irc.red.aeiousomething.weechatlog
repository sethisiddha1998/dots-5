2019-02-23 18:51:06	aeiousomething	what technologies are you good at
2019-02-23 18:51:35	zzzeyez	bash, unix, html5/css3
2019-02-23 18:51:48	zzzeyez	little python
2019-02-23 18:52:01	zzzeyez	https://github.com/zzzeyez
2019-02-23 18:52:24	aeiousomething	based on your skills I say you can apply to positions as linux sysadmin
2019-02-23 18:52:39	aeiousomething	is that what you were looking at
2019-02-23 18:52:47	zzzeyez	yeah
2019-02-23 18:52:53	zzzeyez	that is mostly what i've wanted to do
2019-02-23 18:53:18	aeiousomething	ok the suggestion abuot getting a certificate is not a bad one tbh
2019-02-23 18:53:30	zzzeyez	should i aim for a+ cert or a different one?
2019-02-23 18:53:41	aeiousomething	I think a+ is more of a generic tech job
2019-02-23 18:53:42	zzzeyez	the a+ one feels so outdated
2019-02-23 18:53:46	aeiousomething	I think there are a couple of redhat ones
2019-02-23 18:53:48	aeiousomething	that might be better
2019-02-23 18:53:59	zzzeyez	ok i will look into what certs help with sysadmin
2019-02-23 18:54:02	aeiousomething	https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa
2019-02-23 18:54:14	aeiousomething	damn my brain is still p good at pulling up random bits of information
2019-02-23 18:54:20	aeiousomething	that one is golden if you can pass it
2019-02-23 18:54:25	aeiousomething	shouldn't be too hard I think
2019-02-23 18:55:00	zzzeyez	awesome ty
2019-02-23 18:55:20	aeiousomething	ok the next step is, you can do this before or after the sysadmin cert
2019-02-23 18:55:38	aeiousomething	but doing it after might be more concrete in terms of chances of landing a job
2019-02-23 18:55:43	aeiousomething	it's your choice
2019-02-23 18:55:47	aeiousomething	make a linkedin profile
2019-02-23 18:56:19	zzzeyez	i have one actually i just never made use of it
2019-02-23 18:56:20	zzzeyez	ty
2019-02-23 18:56:21	aeiousomething	with the title sysadmin (don't write any bs like 'actively looking for a sysadmin job')
2019-02-23 18:56:33	aeiousomething	just call yourself sysadmin .. put oyur certification on there 
2019-02-23 18:56:36	zzzeyez	ok
2019-02-23 18:56:46	aeiousomething	writing anything in terms of ('actively seeking' somehow seems to turn off recruiters)
2019-02-23 18:56:50	zzzeyez	yeah i'm super good at interviews etc 
2019-02-23 18:57:02	zzzeyez	i could see that
2019-02-23 18:57:05	aeiousomething	the entire job industry is like dating.. they fucking want what they can't have.. it's the sad unfortunate truth of human nature 
2019-02-23 18:57:14	zzzeyez	yep yep lol
2019-02-23 18:57:27	aeiousomething	I think that's mostly it
2019-02-23 18:57:35	aeiousomething	don't use your linkedin profile to make any posts or anything else
2019-02-23 18:57:39	aeiousomething	literally, don't even like stuff
2019-02-23 18:57:43	zzzeyez	ight
2019-02-23 18:57:53	aeiousomething	idk where you are but
2019-02-23 18:57:59	aeiousomething	if you're anywhere around a major city
2019-02-23 18:58:09	zzzeyez	redhat cert is great idea and seems way funner than a+
2019-02-23 18:58:10	aeiousomething	switch your location in your linkedin profile to that major city (if you are willing to move)
2019-02-23 18:58:23	zzzeyez	i am a traveler but i want to stop traveling
2019-02-23 18:58:41	aeiousomething	it's going to be harder and will look solid on your resume because you will have to prep a lot to ace it
2019-02-23 18:58:55	aeiousomething	anyway pick a major city and set it as your linkedin location even before you move there
2019-02-23 18:58:56	zzzeyez	ya i can drive wherever and sleep in my van
2019-02-23 18:59:04	aeiousomething	tell recruiters you plan on moving there soon ish..
2019-02-23 18:59:32	aeiousomething	try to focus your energy on recruiters that work for the company you want to work for ..
2019-02-23 18:59:52	aeiousomething	a.k.a not consultant recruiters who don't know their dick from their nose
2019-02-23 19:00:14	zzzeyez	what's the difference btween consultant recruiters and the other?
2019-02-23 19:00:30	aeiousomething	the ones you need to focus on will work directly for the company you're going to work for
2019-02-23 19:00:36	aeiousomething	ex. microsoft internal recruiter
2019-02-23 19:00:42	aeiousomething	internal recruiter is probably the proper term
2019-02-23 19:00:51	zzzeyez	ok ic
2019-02-23 19:01:05	aeiousomething	i.e., they work directly for the company and are not some idiot who works for a tech consulting form.. those kids are obnoxious and often illiterate
2019-02-23 19:01:23	aeiousomething	internal recruiter has more power to influence the decision of having someone call you
2019-02-23 19:01:39	aeiousomething	the best a consultant rec can do is hype up your profile and they are skeevy af
2019-02-23 19:02:10	aeiousomething	anyway, once you land a phone call be polite, don't give out any numbers as to salary expectaions.. be mostly honest and don't answer things you don't want to answer
2019-02-23 19:02:43	aeiousomething	tell them you will get to salary expectations once you feel like you're a good fit for the role and the team 
2019-02-23 19:03:00	aeiousomething	and be honest that you are trying to get a leg-in into the industry
2019-02-23 19:04:09	aeiousomething	finally, if you land an in person interview: be confident, be polite, don't sell yourself short or oversell yourself.. try to find a balance .. and don't wear a suit to the interview.. dress formal but no suit
2019-02-23 19:07:04	zzzeyez	cool ok
2019-02-23 19:07:17	zzzeyez	i did a phone interview once and didn't get it because i didn't understand port forwarding enough
2019-02-23 19:07:30	zzzeyez	but i will keep that salary expectations thing in mind
2019-02-23 19:08:23	aeiousomething	yeah it is important .. coz once you ace the interview you can quote any number you want
2019-02-23 19:08:48	aeiousomething	you need to be well versed with things like port forwarding .. that sort of thing is considered somewhat basic but you only learn by going to more interviews
2019-02-23 19:09:03	aeiousomething	don't be demotivated when you fail an interview
2019-02-23 19:09:15	aeiousomething	it's quite literally how everyone learns
2019-02-23 19:09:21	aeiousomething	gotta hustle
2019-02-23 19:10:33	zzzeyez	for sure, i have since became good with port forwarding
2019-02-23 19:10:55	aeiousomething	whatever you do, don't lie about something you don't know
2019-02-23 19:11:08	zzzeyez	lol ok
2019-02-23 19:11:10	aeiousomething	ex., if it's something like port fwding that you don't know 
2019-02-23 19:11:16	aeiousomething	and they ask
2019-02-23 19:11:20	aeiousomething	you have two options
2019-02-23 19:11:25	aeiousomething	a) tell them you don't know out right
2019-02-23 19:11:33	aeiousomething	and that you will look it up after the interview
2019-02-23 19:11:41	zzzeyez	for sure
2019-02-23 19:11:52	aeiousomething	b) tell them you don't know and that you are trying to make an educated guess (if you can)
2019-02-23 19:12:15	aeiousomething	you can tell them you're not sure for the second one instead of don't know
2019-02-23 19:12:23	aeiousomething	but never lie or try to answer something you are not 100% sure of
2019-02-23 19:12:31	aeiousomething	they see that as a sign of unwillingness to learn
2019-02-23 19:13:04	aeiousomething	I think that's about it .. feel free to hit me up if you have anymore questions
2019-02-23 19:13:32	aeiousomething	you can prep for the redhat cert from resources online.. the internet is much better for prep material in current day than it was back when I was a teenager
2019-02-23 19:13:45	aeiousomething	good luck!
2019-02-23 19:14:03	zzzeyez	cool thank you lots
2019-02-23 19:14:41	zzzeyez	i think i am pretty capable, and i'm in no rush and have no pressure but i def have wanted to do sysadmin for a bit
2019-02-23 19:41:34	aeiousomething	don't waste time waiting
2019-02-23 19:41:38	aeiousomething	just go for it 
2019-02-23 19:41:52	zzzeyez	yeah i probably should
2019-02-23 19:41:53	zzzeyez	ok i will
2019-02-23 19:42:04	zzzeyez	i just like.. i live in my van and travel and it's hard for me to hold a job
2019-02-23 19:42:18	zzzeyez	so i don't want that to get in the way
2019-02-23 19:42:33	zzzeyez	but in the mean time i wanna get the rhcsa cert anyways
2019-02-23 20:18:15	aeiousomething	once you get a job you will have more money to settle down and can afford to rent a place 
2019-02-23 20:18:30	aeiousomething	until then don't let the living in a van part let you down
