2018-05-06 13:16:51	S_Seaborn	Hey, trying to figure out how to upload onto kiwi
2018-05-06 13:16:54	S_Seaborn	One sec
2018-05-06 13:17:22	zzzeyez	for future references mods don't like people messaging in here.  you're fine with me lol but
2018-05-06 13:17:43	S_Seaborn	I hear you.
2018-05-06 13:18:38	zzzeyez	it's because some people prey on newcomers etc
2018-05-06 13:18:48	S_Seaborn	Yeah, 
2018-05-06 13:19:08	S_Seaborn	I usually don't unless its something specific like this...or it's a user I go back 3+ years with
2018-05-06 13:20:35	S_Seaborn	Okay, here's one

2018-05-06 13:21:17	S_Seaborn	These are mockups for a desktop site as well as a call to action. 
2018-05-06 13:21:55	S_Seaborn	This was the feedback I got from Round 1: Thanks for sending this! We like your writing and the overall vibe and style you conveyed, but we don't feel like—if these were landing pages—it would be totally clear for the user what to do, or what plan they were fitting into. 
2018-05-06 13:21:56	S_Seaborn	We've often found that a list of options or instructions is really bad, because people then have to decide and they don't know what to do. 
2018-05-06 13:21:57	S_Seaborn	So we were wondering if you could do another round and try to get at this piece of things. Like, make it so that when somebody lands on one of these pages, they're definitely doing something significant. Would that be alright? 
2018-05-06 13:22:03	S_Seaborn	So, these are supposed to address that.
2018-05-06 13:28:22	zzzeyez	ok first i will address from the perspective of a designer:  it all looks great except the font on both the mission statement and the titles of the forms (name, email address, etc) and the tone of the blue and red need a bit of tweaking (just barely)
2018-05-06 13:29:02	zzzeyez	other then that yeah it's perfectly professional.  and now i'll touch on their criticism and the functionality of the page in a bit (i'm experiencing brain fog)
2018-05-06 13:29:13	S_Seaborn	Yep
2018-05-06 13:29:35	S_Seaborn	Thank you :)
2018-05-06 13:31:22	zzzeyez	ok i get what they are saying.  do remember the average viewer has no attention span (me included) so you have to make everything very quick and immediate.  but what's most important closest to the top and make it as quick as possible
2018-05-06 13:31:55	zzzeyez	but hey just changing the font of the mission statement might make it more accessible
2018-05-06 13:32:21	zzzeyez	who knows, that's on them.  anyways.  nice work
2018-05-06 13:32:37	S_Seaborn	Thank you! :)
2018-05-06 13:32:47	S_Seaborn	Not bad for a guy who just taught himself how to do all this, lol
2018-05-06 13:32:53	zzzeyez	yeah i'm self taught too
2018-05-06 13:32:54	zzzeyez	fun stuff
2018-05-06 13:33:04	zzzeyez	anyways.  nice chat, see ya around
2018-05-06 13:33:10	S_Seaborn	Likewise!
