2018-04-23 20:57:23		#macosx: Cannot send to channel
2018-04-23 20:57:37	Cpuroast	tehStickMan: not much
2018-04-23 20:58:21	Cpuroast	N0ZYC: esata is pretty useless, USB3 is worth it, SSD is the best upgrade you can do to any system
2018-04-23 20:58:27	Cpuroast	N0ZYC: more so than extra ram
2018-04-23 20:58:52	N0ZYC	tehStickMan: well as for esata, it's more to just play around with for now, I don't have anything that can do esata and I hav a few external drives (including a new raid) that have it in addition to usb port
2018-04-23 20:59:36	Cpuroast	USB3 and Thunderbolt pretty much completely eleiminiated eSATA
2018-04-23 20:59:39	Cpuroast	eliminated
2018-04-23 20:59:44	N0ZYC	I have a few SSDs I could shoehorn in I suppose, though installing one into the pcie slot is probably a better plan
2018-04-23 20:59:53	Cpuroast	any SSD
2018-04-23 20:59:57	N0ZYC	this mac pro is just old enough to not have BT
2018-04-23 20:59:57	Cpuroast	is better than a HDD
2018-04-23 20:59:58	N0ZYC	TB
2018-04-23 21:00:05	Cpuroast	as far as responsiveness 
2018-04-23 21:00:31	N0ZYC	I'd like to see how USN3 and esata compare
2018-04-23 21:00:32	zzzeyez	i've never installed stuff with make before, and i want to install this: https://github.com/DrabWeb/iTerm2
2018-04-23 21:00:32		#macosx: Cannot send to channel
2018-04-23 21:00:36	N0ZYC	usb3
2018-04-23 21:00:47	Cpuroast	it all depends on the USB3 bridge chip
2018-04-23 21:01:01	N0ZYC	are either hot swap on the m ac?
2018-04-23 21:01:02	N0ZYC	mac

2018-04-23 21:01:17	N0ZYC	I mean between sata and esata
2018-04-23 21:01:19	Cpuroast	eSATA probably not
2018-04-23 21:01:26	N0ZYC	I thought it was supposed to be ?
2018-04-23 21:01:35	Cpuroast	depends on how old the chipset is
2018-04-23 21:01:41	Cpuroast	eSATA is just SATA
2018-04-23 21:01:44	Cpuroast	with a diff connector
2018-04-23 21:01:47	N0ZYC	I've read some reports that say things that should be hot swap on the mac aren't because the mac os doesn't support that
2018-04-23 21:01:48	Cpuroast	and cable
2018-04-23 21:01:50	Cpuroast	it's identical
2018-04-23 21:02:15	N0ZYC	so eSata is just External Sata
2018-04-23 21:02:18	Cpuroast	yes
2018-04-23 21:02:23	N0ZYC	makes sense
2018-04-23 21:02:44	Cpuroast	USB has the advantage of carrying power
2018-04-23 21:02:45	zzzeyez	i've never installed stuff with make before, and i want to install this: https://github.com/DrabWeb/iTerm2  i have xcode-select and make installed.  i did make, and then i did make install.  i don't know if it's installed.  where would it be?
2018-04-23 21:02:46	N0ZYC	actually come to think of it I did have an esata expresscard a long time ago
2018-04-23 21:02:58	Cpuroast	so you can have things like bus-powered pocket drives
2018-04-23 21:02:59	Cpuroast	and such
2018-04-23 21:02:59	N0ZYC	that was on my tibook iirc
2018-04-23 21:03:18	N0ZYC	does esata carry power?
2018-04-23 21:03:19	Cpuroast	no
2018-04-23 21:03:26	N0ZYC	didn't think so
2018-04-23 21:03:26	Cpuroast	eSATA is just SATA
2018-04-23 21:03:27	Cpuroast	:)
2018-04-23 21:03:43	N0ZYC	anywho, off to bed
2018-04-23 21:03:46	Cpuroast	USB 3.1 Gen 2 is now at 10Gbit
2018-04-23 21:03:53	Cpuroast	TB 3.0 at 40Gbit

2018-04-23 21:04:02	Branes	N0ZYC: Something to remember: macOS does not permit SATA hotswap.
2018-04-23 21:04:02	Cpuroast	so yeah the lowly 6Gbit SATA3
2018-04-23 21:04:06	Cpuroast	has been surpassed
2018-04-23 21:04:42	Branes	I'm with Roasty, forget eSATA, add SSD and USB3
2018-04-23 21:05:02	Branes	UASP over USB3 is faster than Thunderbolt, in some instances.

2018-04-24 02:01:20	Sir_Designer	Nauru had 11,347 residents as of July 2016, making it the second smallest sovereign state after Vatican City.[90] The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500 people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by large force reductions in phosphate mining.[81] Nauru is the least populous country in Oceania.

2018-04-24 02:02:37	Sir_Designer	According to a report published in 1937 in Sydney, there was a diversity of dialects until Nauru became a colony of Germany in 1888, and until the introduction of publication of the first texts written in Nauruan. The variations were largely so different that people of various districts often had problems understanding each other completely. With the increasing influence of foreign languages and the increase of Nauruan texts, the dialects
2018-04-24 02:02:37	Sir_Designer	 blended into a standardized language, which was promoted through dictionaries and translations by Alois Kayser and Philip Delaporte.
2018-04-24 02:02:37	Sir_Designer	Today there is significantly less dialectal variation. In the district of Yaren and the surrounding area there is an eponymous dialect spoken, which is only slightly different.

2018-04-24 12:09:36	@MacinMan	I was also wondering if apple changed how they distribute iOS updates ? Usually if I download an update, and the display goes to sleep it will wait until I'm back and wake up the display and start the update.  Today both the iPhone and iPad went through and updated on their own
2018-04-24 12:09:51	@MacinMan	All I did was tell it to download

2019-04-05 22:27:19	zzzeyez	does anyone else have Automator-created .apps running shell scripts that stopped working after updating to Mojave?
2019-04-05 22:27:38	@Doctor_	Not I
2019-04-05 22:27:44	@Doctor_	What did your app(s) do?

2019-04-05 22:28:36	zzzeyez	it used to work just fine
2019-04-05 22:29:14	@Doctor_	If you run that script in a bash shell, does it work?
2019-04-05 22:29:15	zzzeyez	also an app i had that changed my wine prefix and then ran an .exe in wine
2019-04-05 22:29:19	zzzeyez	yep
2019-04-05 22:29:37	@Doctor_	Does the existing app tell you what the error is when you try to run it?
2019-04-05 22:29:39	zzzeyez	it works fine in the terminal, but i miss being able to run it and close it from the dock

2019-04-05 22:30:31	Branes	zzzeyez: Mojave added a new security abstraction method called Transparency Consent & Control that'll play havoc with your scripts. Read about it here: https://blog.fleetsmith.com/tcc-a-quick-primer/

2019-04-05 22:35:09	@Doctor_	It doesn't look like TCC should be too much of an issue for these; the Automator app should be bringing up a confirm-or-deny dialogue for those

2019-04-05 22:35:43	@Doctor_	zzzeyez: maybe run the bash script through an Applescript Editor-generated .app ? 
2019-04-05 22:35:51	@Doctor_	Or not, that'd be essentially the same thing as the Automator app
2019-04-05 22:36:34	zzzeyez	i've generated the app with appify, platypus and automator
2019-04-05 22:36:44	zzzeyez	i'll try applescript but it feels like a lost cause:(

2019-04-05 22:38:54	zzzeyez	that's a fake api key so it wouldn't work

2019-04-05 22:39:23	zzzeyez	i wrote a notification tool called notify-send and it just notifys me whatever track is being played on last.fm
2019-04-05 22:41:13	@Doctor_	Cool. Is it more efficient than using a dedicated app for the task?

2019-04-05 22:49:52	zzzeyez	sounds like a plan!
2019-04-05 22:50:12	zzzeyez	either way i want to investigate this more because i am completely confused at what is going on
2019-04-05 22:50:32	Branes	Might be also worth checking the Privacy prefpane and grant your applets extra permission.
