2018-03-20 21:57:54	zzzeyez	is there a way to use a back-up value if a variable does not exist?  for example: "line-height: var(--pollen-height), 10px;" where 10px would be the line-height if var(--pollen-height) does not exist?

2018-03-21 11:28:57	stennowork	it maybe works if the container has a rem width/height?
2018-03-21 11:29:37	preaction	SVG
2018-03-21 11:29:40	no_gravity	Via JS one could measure the width and then calculate a new width.
2018-03-21 11:30:10	stennowork	oh yeah svg is one that it is at least compatible with modern browsers
2018-03-21 11:30:19	stennowork	but thats probably not what no_gravity wants
2018-03-21 11:30:42	no_gravity	Hmm... feels a bit ugly to use SVG. But maybe it's a nice solution.
2018-03-21 11:30:50	preaction	i tend to use vw/vmax to get some responsiveness out of font sizes, but svg is the current best practice

2018-03-21 11:31:29	garyserj	I am looking at this website, http://lbh.neowebservices.co.uk/ there is a widget at the top for changing font size and colour.  I can't find the css file that has the styling for that thing
2018-03-21 11:31:34	stennowork	vw would work only if the container is also vw - it basically leads to having to set the height specifically anyway
2018-03-21 11:32:10	no_gravity	Whats the shortest code to show a text via svg?
